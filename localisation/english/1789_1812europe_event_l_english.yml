russianempire_1789_1812.137.d:0 "In response to British interference with neutral shipping during the ongoing wars in Europe, Russia proposes the revival of the League of Armed Neutrality. The goal is to defend neutral trade and maritime rights from British blockade and aggression."
russianempire_1789_1812.138.d:0 "Russia has proposed a renewal of the League of Armed Neutrality. Denmark, with a strong naval tradition and neutral commerce at stake, must decide whether to align with Russia against British interference or maintain a cautious stance."
russianempire_1789_1812.139.d:0 "Sweden has received Russia’s proposal for a second League of Armed Neutrality. Though it values trade and maritime sovereignty, it must weigh the risk of angering Britain against its historical rivalry and recent tensions with Russia."
russianempire_1789_1812.140.d:0 "Prussia has been approached by Russia to support the revival of the League of Armed Neutrality. While not a naval power, Prussia’s alignment would send a strong diplomatic message to Britain—and possibly invite retaliation."
russianempire_1789_1812.141.d:0 "After much negotiation, Russia, Denmark, Sweden, and Prussia have agreed to revive the League of Armed Neutrality. Together, they stand united against British interference in neutral trade, hoping to protect their maritime rights."
russianempire_1789_1812.142.d:0 "Despite Russia’s efforts, Denmark, Sweden, and/or Prussia have declined to join the League of Armed Neutrality. Without their support, the coalition is weakened and Britain’s dominance over the seas remains unchallenged."
russianempire_1789_1812.143.d:0 "France’s continued expansion and subversion of Europe’s monarchies has left Russia with no choice but to act. In alliance with Austria, Britain, and other European powers, Russia has agreed to join the Second Coalition. A united front will now confront the revolutionary tide threatening the balance of power in Europe."
russianempire_1789_1812.144.d:0 "As the Georgian kingdoms of Kartli-Kakheti and Imereti face pressure from Persia and internal instability, the Russian Empire has proposed a diplomatic solution: unifying the two kingdoms into a single Georgian realm under joint Russo-Ottoman protection. Rather than vying for dominance, both empires would guarantee Georgian sovereignty within a neutral zone. This unprecedented condominium aims to preserve peace in the Caucasus without resorting to war or annexation."
russianempire_1789_1812.145.d:0 "A proposal has arrived from the court of Catherine II. The Russians seek to merge Kartli-Kakheti and Imereti into a unified Georgian kingdom, governed independently but overseen by both empires as neutral guarantors. The Sublime Porte must now consider whether to entertain such a radical arrangement, which could stabilize the Caucasus—or grant Russia further influence under the guise of peace."
russianempire_1789_1812.146.d:0 "In a rare act of cooperation, the Russian and Ottoman Empires have agreed to recognize a united Georgian kingdom composed of Kartli-Kakheti and Imereti. The new polity will remain neutral, its sovereignty guaranteed jointly by both powers. This condominium avoids further conflict in the Caucasus, balances regional influence, and grants the Georgian crown a chance at national consolidation."
russianempire_1789_1812.147.d:0 "The Sublime Porte has rejected Russia's proposal to unify the Georgian kingdoms under a neutral, jointly protected crown. The Ottomans view such an arrangement as a thinly veiled attempt to expand Russian influence under diplomatic cover. With no accord reached, the Caucasus remains divided, and Georgia's fate hangs between foreign ambitions and local resistance."
russianempire_1789_1812.148.d:0 "Following the death of King George XII and the internal instability of the eastern Georgian kingdom, Tsar Paul I decreed the formal annexation of Kartli-Kakheti in 1801. This marked the beginning of Russia’s imperial expansion into the Caucasus. The once-independent Christian monarchy was abolished, and Russian administrative control was established over Tbilisi and the surrounding lands."
russianempire_1789_1812.149.d:0 "In 1810, after years of strained vassalage and open defiance by King Solomon II, the Russian Empire moved decisively to eliminate the last vestiges of Imeretian autonomy. Russian troops entered Kutaisi, the monarchy was dissolved, and Imereti was absorbed into the imperial fold. The conquest extended Russian rule to the western heart of the Georgian highlands."
russianempire_1789_1812.150.d:0 "Though long a protectorate, Guria's autonomy ended following the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829. On 2 September 1829, the principality was formally annexed. With little resistance, Russian administration replaced the Gurieli dynasty, and the Black Sea coast came firmly under imperial control."
russianempire_1789_1812.151.d:0 "Svaneti, nestled deep in the Caucasus mountains, long resisted external rule. After a series of confrontations and punitive expeditions, Russian forces subdued the fiercely independent region between 1857 and 1858. The local prince was removed, and Russian imperial authority was extended to even the most remote highland valleys."
russianempire_1789_1812.152.d:0 "Initially brought under Russian protection in 1810, Abkhazia retained a measure of internal autonomy for decades. However, following the end of the Caucasian War in 1864, the Russian Empire abolished the Shervashidze principality. Abkhazia was integrated directly into the empire, completing the long and bloody consolidation of the northwest Caucasus."
russianempire_1789_1812.153.d:0 "Though a Russian protectorate since 1803, the Principality of Mingrelia maintained its ruling Dadiani dynasty for over sixty years. Finally, on 4 January 1867, Prince Niko Dadiani was deposed, and Mingrelia was absorbed into the empire. The annexation marked the end of Georgian princely independence and the total imperial domination of the region."
russianempire_1789_1812.154.d:0 "With the Treaty of Adrianople signed and Guria formally annexed on September 2, 1829, Russia's hold on the Black Sea coast solidified. Yet the imperial gaze now turned further inland—toward the misty mountains and divided principalities of Svaneti, Abkhazia, and Mingrelia. From the winter of 1829 onward, Russian diplomats and generals laid the groundwork for deeper control over the western Caucasus. Friendly treaties, military roads, and veiled threats became tools of choice, as St. Petersburg plotted the gradual absorption of these semi-independent lands into the imperial structure over the next decades."
russianempire_1789_1812.155.d:0 "The Treaty of Turkmenchay has been signed between the Russian Empire and Qajar Persia, marking a decisive end to the Second Russo-Persian War. In the treaty, Persia formally cedes the Erivan, Nakhchivan, and Talysh Khanates to Russia. The Russian Empire now controls nearly all of the South Caucasus, securing dominance over the Caspian coast and a strong southern frontier. Persia also agrees to pay a heavy indemnity, grant extraterritorial rights to Russian subjects, and permit Russian merchants to trade freely throughout Persian territory. This treaty greatly expands Russian influence in the region and sets the stage for further pressure on Persia in the years to come. With the Caucasus firmly under imperial control, the empire now turns its attention to consolidating its gains and preparing for future challenges to the south."
russianempire_1789_1812.156.d:0 "Following the fall of Venice, the Ionian Islands became a strategic point of contention in the Mediterranean. Initially under French control, they soon fell into the Russian sphere of influence with the establishment of the Septinsular Republic — a rare example of a Russian-backed constitutional state. Though nominally autonomous, the republic served both Russian naval interests and regional Orthodox ambitions."
russianempire_1789_1812.157.d:0 "The Finnish War erupted between Sweden and the Russian Empire in 1808, a result of diplomatic pressure from Napoleon and longstanding territorial tensions. Russian forces swiftly advanced into Finland, exploiting Sweden’s internal instability. The war would determine the fate of Finland and further isolate Sweden from the continental powers."
russianempire_1789_1812.158.d:0 "The Treaty of Fredrikshamn marked the end of the Finnish War in 1809. As a result of Sweden's defeat, Finland was ceded to the Russian Empire, becoming an autonomous Grand Duchy under the Tsar. This not only reshaped the northern balance of power but granted Russia a new strategic frontier facing Sweden and the Baltic Sea."
russianempire_1789_1812.159.d:0 "Russian forces occupied the Danubian Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia during the Russo-Turkish War, securing key crossings and reinforcing their influence over southeastern Europe. While officially claimed as temporary occupations, these moves heightened tensions with the Ottoman Empire and alarmed Austria."
russianempire_1789_1812.160.d:0 "Faced with growing Russian encroachments into the Balkans and the occupation of Moldavia and Wallachia, the Ottoman Empire declared war on the Russian Empire. This declaration escalated the ongoing hostilities into full-scale war, setting the stage for yet another brutal Russo-Turkish conflict."
russianempire_1789_1812.161.d:0 "The Treaty of Bucharest, signed in 1812, brought an end to the Russo-Turkish War. Russia secured the annexation of Bessarabia, further expanding its frontier into Eastern Europe. The Ottomans, weakened and diplomatically isolated, accepted unfavorable terms to avoid further devastation."
russianempire_1789_1812.162.d:0 "With the flames of rebellion igniting across Greater Poland, many Polish revolutionaries sought protection and alliance under Napoleon's France. Disillusioned with Russian domination and inspired by French revolutionary ideals, they appealed to join the French sphere of influence, hoping for eventual restoration of Polish sovereignty."
russianempire_1789_1812.163.d:0 "The Greater Polish uprising intensified, and its leaders formally expressed a desire to join the French cause. This act symbolized a break with the Russian Empire and a rallying cry for Polish nationalism. Their allegiance to France was both ideological and strategic — a gamble on Napoleon's promises."
russianempire_1789_1812.164.d:0 "With the assassination of Paul I and the ascension of Alexander I, the Second League of Armed Neutrality effectively collapsed. Alexander, more pragmatic and diplomatically cautious, distanced Russia from Paul’s confrontational maritime policies. The League’s dissolution marked the end of Russia’s challenge to British naval dominance in the early 19th century."

Barricades rose, musket volleys rang out — and the Republic nearly fell. It was a young artillery officer, Napoleon Bonaparte, who saved the government with a decisive and bloody cannonade. The insurgents were crushed, and Bonaparte’s star began its meteoric rise. Though the Republic survived, the event showed just how precarious its hold on power had become."

On 9 Thermidor Year II, a coalition of moderates and disillusioned Jacobins struck down Robespierre and his allies in the National Convention. The guillotine, once Robespierre’s instrument, claimed him the next day. With the fall of the Incorruptible, the Jacobin dictatorship crumbled. A more cautious and pragmatic phase of the Revolution begins — but the scars of the Terror run deep, and vengeance, opportunism, and reaction are in the air."

Between May and June 1793, the radical Jacobins, led by Robespierre and the Montagnards, ousted the moderate Girondins from the National Convention in a mix of street agitation and political coercion. Backed by the sans-culottes and the Paris Commune, the Jacobins now dominate the Republic.

fra_1789_event.207.d:0 "By late 1799, the royalist insurrection in the Vendée was finally crushed after years of brutal conflict. General Brune and other Republican commanders defeated the remaining Chouan and Vendéen forces, ending organized resistance in western France. Exhausted by war, famine, and repeated failure, the royalist cause in the region collapsed. With peace gradually returning, the government could now turn its full attention to stabilizing the Republic and consolidating power under the rising figure of Napoleon Bonaparte."
fra_1789_event.208.d:0 "After years of revolution, bloodshed, and economic upheaval, the mood across France is shifting. It is now the winter of 1796, and the promises of liberty and equality have given way to exhaustion and disillusionment. In the countryside, peasants grumble about requisitions and conscription; in the cities, the middle classes yearn for stability and the return of order. The radical Jacobin rhetoric that once stirred the people now feels distant — and dangerous.\n\nConservative voices, once silenced, are now growing louder. Royalist sympathies flicker back to life, cloaked in the language of moderation and legality. Clergymen and notables are finding confidence again, and even within the halls of government, the call for tradition is no longer whispered but spoken aloud.\n\nAs elections approach, it becomes increasingly clear: the French people are turning away from revolutionary fever. The pendulum is swinging — and with it, the future of the Republic hangs in the balance."
fra_1789_event.209.d:0 "The elections of 1797 marked a dramatic political turning point for the French Republic. Backed by monarchist sympathizers, ex-revolutionary moderates, and even some former royal officials, conservative candidates won a commanding majority in the Council of Five Hundred and the Council of Ancients.\n\nThis victory signaled not only public exhaustion with revolutionary politics but also growing demands for political normalcy, religious tolerance, and restored property rights. Conservative deputies called for peace with European monarchies, the dismantling of Jacobin clubs, and even whispered of a constitutional monarchy. The Directory, alarmed by these developments, would soon respond—not with compromise, but with force."
fra_1789_event.210.d:0 "Amid rising internal threats and growing political tension, the French government took decisive steps to centralize control over public order. The Ministry of Police was established in 1796 as a powerful tool to monitor dissent, suppress royalist conspiracies, and maintain revolutionary discipline across the nation.\n\nUnder its expanding mandate, the Ministry developed a vast surveillance network—agents, informants, and political commissioners—charged with rooting out counter-revolutionaries, press agitators, and suspected émigré sympathizers. It quickly became one of the most feared institutions in France.\n\nThough ostensibly created to protect the Republic, the Ministry of Police would soon evolve into a vehicle of authoritarian control, paving the way for more ambitious men to seize power—not least among them, Napoleon Bonaparte."

Under the command of General Bonaparte, hopes run high that swift and decisive victories will secure France’s position against Austrian influence and spread the Revolution’s ideals.
