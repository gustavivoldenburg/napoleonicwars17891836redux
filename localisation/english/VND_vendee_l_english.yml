  vendee_new.1.a: "The First Coalition win The war"
  vendee_new.1.b: "After years of bitter conflict that consumed hundreds of thousands of lives and devastated vast regions of France, the revolutionary government has been decisively defeated. The remnants of the National Convention surrendered unconditionally following the fall of Paris to Prussian forces under Field Marshal von Möllendorf.\n\nThe Treaty of Paris, signed in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles, formally recognizes Louis XVII as the legitimate King of France"
  vendee.1.a: "Rescue The King"
  vendee.1.b: "In the dead of night, Vendéen loyalists executed a daring operation to extract the young Louis XVII from his captors in Paris. The boy-king, weak from months of imprisonment and mistreatment, was spirited away through secret passages and hidden routes known only to the most faithful royalists.\n\nAs the rescue party made their desperate flight toward Vendéen-held territory, they encountered an unexpected group of armed men blocking the forest road. Tension mounted as both sides raised their weapons—until their leader stepped forward with raised hands.\n\n'Hold your fire! We are Federalists from the Gironde,' the man announced. 'We may not share your dreams of absolute monarchy, but we share your hatred of the Jacobin tyranny. That boy deserves to live, whatever crown he may or may not wear.'\n\nThe Federalist commander introduced himself and his men—former National Guardsmen, moderate republicans, and constitutional monarchists who had fled the Terror. They offered supplies, fresh horses, and safe passage through territories they still influenced.\n\n'We seek a France of laws and liberty,' he continued, 'not the blood-soaked madness of Robespierre. Perhaps, in time, we might find common cause. A constitutional settlement, perhaps? The boy could reign, but under a charter that protects the rights of all Frenchmen.'\n\nThe Vendéen commanders faced a choice: accept these unlikely allies and consider their political proposal, or view them as republicans nonetheless—traitors who had once supported the Revolution that murdered the King."

  VND_royalist_path: "You choose to kill the federalist in Rescue The king Event"
  vendee.2.a: "Behind Closed Doors"
  vendee.2.b: "The rescue party finally reached the safety of a Vendéen outpost as dawn broke over the Loire valley. Louis XVII, still dressed in the tattered prison clothes that hung loosely on his malnourished frame, was brought into a warm room—perhaps the first warmth he had felt in months.\n\nAs loyal officers knelt before their young sovereign, the boy remained silent, his eyes hollow and distant. A physician was summoned, and food was brought, though the child barely touched it. It was only when an elderly officer—a man who had once served at Versailles—gently asked about his captivity that the dam finally broke.\n\nIn a quiet, broken voice, Louis XVII began to speak of the Temple Prison. He told of the darkness of his cell, where sunlight never reached. Of the screams he heard through the walls—his mother's screams, his aunt's prayers, sounds that haunted his sleepless nights. He spoke of Simon the cobbler, the brutal guardian appointed by the Committee, who had beaten him for refusing to denounce his own mother as a whore and a traitor.\n\n'They made me sing their songs,' the boy whispered, tears streaming down his face. 'The songs about killing kings. They laughed when I cried. They... they told me Maman was dead. That they had killed her. Is it true? Is she...?'\n\nThe room fell into awful silence. Every man present felt his blood turn to ice, then to fire. The child before them had been broken by monsters who called themselves liberators. Some officers wept openly. Others gripped their sword hilts until their knuckles turned white.\n\nThis was what the Revolution had done. This was what they were fighting against. Not abstract principles or political philosophy—but this. A tortured child who had committed no crime except being born into the wrong family.\n\nThe boy-king would need time to heal, if such wounds ever could heal. But one thing was certain: the men of the Vendée now knew, with absolute clarity, that their cause was just."
  vendee.2.c: "The Republic will answer for these crimes."
  vendee.2.d: "We must protect him from ever suffering again."
  vendee.3.a: "The Question of Women soldier"
  vendee.3.b: "The civil war has ended. The tricolor lies trampled in the mud, replaced once more by the white banner of the Bourbons. Church bells ring across a France exhausted by years of bloodshed. But in the victory parades, something unprecedented catches the eye of foreign observers and traditionalists alike—women in uniform, bearing arms, marching alongside their male comrades.\n\nThe women of the Vendée had taken up arms out of desperate necessity. When the Republic's armies came with fire and blade, when priests were drowned and villages burned, the women fought beside their fathers, husbands, and brothers. Some became scouts and messengers. Others loaded muskets and tended the wounded. A few, like the legendary Marie-Louise Victoire de Donnissan, led men into battle themselves.\n\nNow, with peace restored, these women await the young King's judgment. Many wish to return to their homes, their farms, their families—the war having taken enough from them already. But others, having tasted freedom and purpose in the ranks, petition to remain in service. They argue that they have proven themselves in blood, that they have earned the right to serve France as soldiers.\n\nThe court is divided. Conservative advisors argue that women bearing arms violates natural order and tradition—that France must return to proper Christian values after years of revolutionary chaos. Others, particularly younger officers who fought alongside these women, argue that merit and loyalty matter more than tradition, that these women bled for the King and deserve recognition.\n\nThe Catholic bishops offer no clear guidance, torn between admiration for these Judith-like defenders of the faith and concern for proper social order.\n\nLouis XVII, now a young man hardened by childhood suffering and years of war, must decide. Will he honor tradition and demobilize all female soldiers? Will he create a special auxiliary corps that acknowledges their service while maintaining separation? Or will he take the radical step of allowing them to serve as equals—a decision that would shock every court in Europe?"
  vendee.3.c: "Women soldiers are discharged with honors and pensions."
  vendee.3.d: "Let each woman choose her own path freely."
  french_surrender_done: "Republic Regime is defeated"
  vendee.4.a: "The Empty Throne"
  vendee.4.b: "The great golden gates of Versailles swung open for the first time in years, their hinges groaning like the ghosts of the old regime. Louis XVII sat motionless in the royal carriage as it passed through, his face pale and unreadable. The palace that should have been his childhood home had become a monument to everything he had lost.\n\nThe Republic had fallen. Paris had surrendered after the Coalition forces breached the final barricades. The revolutionary government collapsed into chaos as former Jacobins fled or turned on each other. Some tried to escape abroad; others were dragged from hiding by vengeful crowds. The Committee of Public Safety was no more. The guillotine in the Place de la Révolution stood silent, its blade rusted with the blood of thousands.\n\nAs the young King stepped from his carriage, he stood before the palace where his father had once ruled, where his mother had walked through glittering halls, where his aunt had prayed in the chapel. All of them were gone now—murdered by the Revolution that had promised liberty and delivered only death.\n\nThe palace itself bore the scars of revolutionary fervor. Paintings had been slashed, royal symbols defaced, furniture looted or burned. The Hall of Mirrors, once the greatest room in Europe, was covered in dust and grime. Yet it still stood, wounded but unbroken, like France itself.\n\nVendéen soldiers and Coalition troops lined the courtyards, while crowds gathered at the gates—some weeping with joy at the restoration, others watching in sullen silence, still loyal to republican ideals even in defeat. The bishops waited to offer prayers of thanksgiving. Emigré nobles who had fled years ago now rushed forward, eager to reclaim their positions and properties.\n\nLouis XVII stood at the threshold of his inheritance. He was no longer the terrified boy who had been dragged from this palace by revolutionary mobs. He was no longer the broken child who wept in a prison cell. He was a young man who had survived hell itself and emerged victorious.\n\nBut as he looked up at the vast facade of Versailles, one question burned in his mind: What kind of France would he build from the ashes of the Republic? Would he restore the old order that had fallen so catastrophically? Would he forge something new? Would he show mercy to his enemies, or would the guillotine simply change hands?\n\nThe fate of France now rested on the shoulders of a king who had known only suffering, war, and loss. History held its breath."

  vendee.6.b: "The gardens of Versailles bloomed once more in the spring sunlight, though the palace still bore scars from years of revolutionary occupation. Paris remained under temporary Coalition control, but here at Versailles, a new France was taking shape—one that would blend the throne with the principles of constitutional government.\n\nA delegation of moderate revolutionaries arrived at the palace gates, former Girondins and constitutional monarchists who had survived the Terror. They prepared to offer their oath of loyalty to the young King—and to receive his oath in return, pledging to govern under constitutional law.\n\nLouis XVII received them in the Hall of Mirrors,the King had transformed from the traumatized child rescued from the Temple. The darkness still lurked in his eyes at times, but it had been joined by something else—a quick wit, a gentle humor, and a remarkable absence of bitterness.\n\nAs the delegation knelt to swear their oaths, one elderly Girondin stumbled slightly, his aged knees protesting. Before any courtier could react, Louis XVII himself stepped forward and helped the man to his feet with a warm smile.\n\n'Please, monsieur, there is no need to kneel so long. France has seen enough men on their knees,' the King said softly. 'I would rather have citizens who stand upright than subjects who grovel.'\n\nThe Federalist leader, emboldened, began his prepared speech about constitutional monarchy, the rights of man, and the rule of law. Louis XVII listened attentively, occasionally asking surprisingly astute questions that revealed he had been studying political philosophy intently. When one advisor tried to hurry the proceedings along according to protocol, the King waved him off with a mischievous grin.\n\n'Let them speak, Monsieur le Duc. I spent years in a cell hearing nothing but curses and revolutionary songs. I think I can endure a few hours of political theory.'\n\nAs the ceremony concluded, the King made his own pledge—to govern justly under constitutional law, to protect the rights of all Frenchmen, and to never allow tyranny to rise again, whether in revolutionary or monarchical form. His voice was steady, his words sincere.\n\nYet in private moments afterward, those close to Louis XVII noticed something peculiar. When his tutors tried to impose rigid court etiquette, he would fall into a stubborn, silent resistance—the same silent defiance he had used to survive the Temple Prison. But the moment they softened their approach, he would apologize with disarming sweetness and explain his reasons with thoughtful eloquence.\n\nThe Federalist delegates departed Versailles cautiously optimistic. They had expected either a vengeful tyrant or a weak puppet. Instead, they found a young man who loved riding through the countryside at dawn, who treated servants with kindness, who studied late into the night, and who seemed genuinely committed to healing France's wounds.\n\nOne delegate whispered to another as they departed: 'Perhaps the Revolution did not fail entirely. It gave us a King who understands what it means to suffer, and who does not forget it.'"

  vendee.5.b: "General Charrette burst into the war council chamber, his normally composed demeanor replaced by barely contained excitement. Maps scattered as he slammed his fist on the table with triumphant force.\n\n'Your Majesty, gentlemen—the Federalists have risen!'\n\nThe room erupted in murmurs. Weeks ago, Vendéen agents had smuggled weapons and supplies to Federalist sympathizers in Lyon, Marseille, Bordeaux, and other southern cities. The operation had been risky—trusting republicans, even moderate ones, went against every instinct of the royalist officers. But the gamble had paid off.\n\nReports flooded in throughout the day. In Lyon, the Federalist militia had stormed the Jacobin headquarters, raising banners demanding a constitutional republic and an end to the Terror. Marseille's port district flew the tricolor alongside white flags—a symbolic gesture of alliance. Bordeaux's Girondins, who had been in hiding since their expulsion from the Convention, now commanded the city garrison. Toulouse, Caen, and a dozen smaller cities followed suit.\n\nThe Jacobin Republic now faced enemies on multiple fronts. Their armies, stretched thin fighting the Vendéen forces in the west, could not simultaneously suppress rebellions across the south and east."
  vendee.5.c: "To arm....i guess?"
  vendee.8.a: "What next?"
  vendee.8.b: "The civil war is over. The Jacobins are defeated. Louis XVII sits upon his throne once more. Yet the palace halls echo with an eerie silence—the silence of a kingdom that has lost its soul.\n\nLouis XVII, now twelve years old, shows signs of recovery from his ordeal. The nightmares come less frequently. He smiles occasionally. His tutors report that the young King demonstrates remarkable intelligence and a gentle disposition. But he remains a child—too young to rule a nation teetering on the brink of collapse.\n\nOutside the palace walls, France burns with a different fire. In Paris, occupied by Prussian troops, protesters fill the streets screaming 'Vive la République!' In Lyon, workers riot against food shortages. In Marseille, dock workers refuse to unload ships, demanding a return to revolutionary government. Across the nation, the people cry out: 'We bled for France, and you sold her to foreigners!'\n\nAnd they are not entirely wrong. The price of Vendéen victory was paid in French soil. Calais, seized by English redcoats who now drink tea in French cafés. Border villages in the Pyrenees, ceded to Spain. Strasbourg—proud Strasbourg—split like a carcass between Austrian and Prussian administrators. And Paris herself, the heart of France, occupied by Prussian soldiers who parade daily past the Tuileries in deliberate humiliation.\n\nThe foreign ambassadors make no secret of their contempt. To them, Louis XVII is not a legitimate monarch but a useful puppet. The Coalition powers demand preferential trade treaties, military access, and hefty reparations. They treat France not as an ally but as a conquered province.\n\nThe treasury is empty. The harvest has failed. Inflation spirals out of control. Bread riots erupt weekly. Former republican soldiers, now unemployed and bitter, form secret societies plotting revenge. Royalist administrators, many returned émigrés who fled years ago, govern with tone-deaf arrogance, demanding restoration of feudal privileges that only fuel popular rage.\n\nLouis XVII cannot rule alone—not yet, perhaps not for years. A regent must be appointed to navigate these treacherous waters. But who? Each candidate represents a different vision for France's future, and each choice will determine whether the restored monarchy survives or collapses into a new revolution.\n\nThe King's advisors present four names, each with passionate supporters and bitter enemies."
  vendee.8.c: "A regent? what next......girl education?(if you want girl education choose lafayette!)"
  vendee.10.a: "The promise"
  vendee.10.b: "The morning sun streamed through the tall windows of the versailles as Louis XVII sat at his desk, struggling with Latin declensions.  His tutor droned on about Caesar's Gallic campaigns, but Louis's attention kept drifting to the window, where he could see the palace gardens calling to him.\n\n'Your Majesty, if you could focus on the subjunctive—'\n\n'But Monsieur, didn't Caesar also enjoy riding?' Louis interrupted with a mischievous grin. 'I read that he could dictate letters while on horseback. Surely I could conjugate verbs while riding? It would be more efficient!'\n\nBefore the exasperated tutor could respond, the Chamberlain entered and bowed. 'Sire, a delegation from the Gironde has arrived. They request an audience.'\n\nLouis's face lit up immediately—anything to escape Latin grammar. 'Show them in at once!' He caught his tutor's disapproving look and added sheepishly, 'After the lesson, of course. In... how long, Monsieur?'\n\n'Another hour, Your Majesty.'\n\nLouis slumped dramatically in his chair, then caught himself and sat up straight, trying to look regal. He lasted perhaps thirty seconds before fidgeting with his quill again.\n\nWhen the delegation finally arrived, Louis bounded up from his throne—then remembered himself and sat back down with exaggerated dignity, though his eyes sparkled with barely contained energy. The Federalist leader, a stern-faced lawyer named Vergniaud, bowed formally.\n\n'Your Majesty, we come representing the departments of the Gironde, Brittany, Normandy, and Provence. We seek to remind Your Majesty of the promises made during the dark days of the civil war.'\n\nLouis leaned forward attentively, his sharp mind already working. 'I remember, Monsieur. You helped save my life. I don't forget such things.' His voice was gentle but sincere.\n\nVergniaud seemed surprised by the King's directness. 'Indeed, Sire. And in exchange, we were promised autonomy for our regions—the right to govern our own affairs, to maintain our local assemblies, to—'\n\n'To not have Paris tell you what to do,' Louis finished, smiling slightly. 'I understand. My advisors also don't like it when I refuse to follow their rules.' He glanced at his elderly tutor, who coughed disapprovingly.\n\nThe Federalist delegation exchanged uncertain looks. This was not the haughty absolute monarch they had expected.\n\nVergniaud pressed on. 'Your Majesty, we simply ask that you honor the agreement. Grant us provincial autonomy—let the Gironde govern itself, let Brittany maintain its parliament, let each region—'\n\n'Keep what makes them special,' Louis interrupted again, then caught himself. 'Forgive me, Monsieur, my mother always said I interrupt too much.' He paused, his expression growing more serious. 'But I do understand. You want to be French without forgetting who you are.'\n\nThe young King stood and walked to the window, looking out at Paris. His advisors, standing nearby, looked nervous. The Prime Minister stepped forward.\n\n'Sire, perhaps this matter should be discussed in council—'\n\nLouis waved him off without looking back. 'They came to see me, not the council.' There was a quiet stubbornness in his voice.\n\nHe turned back to the Federalists. 'You saved my life when I was a frightened child in the dark. I won't forget that. But...' He hesitated, choosing his words carefully. 'France is broken, Monsieur Vergniaud. If every region goes its own way, will there even be a France? Or just pieces that used to be something great?'\n\nVergniaud bowed his head respectfully. 'We don't seek to break France, Your Majesty. We seek to save it from the tyranny of centralization—whether Jacobin or royalist. Let each region breathe, and France will be stronger for it.'\n\nLouis was quiet for a long moment, absently bouncing on his heels—a nervous habit his attendants had tried to break him of. Finally, he spoke.\n\n'I need to think about this. And... I should probably ask people who know more than I do.' He smiled self-deprecatingly. 'I'm quite good at riding and geography, but governing... that's harder than Caesar's subjunctive.'\n\nHe walked directly up to Vergniaud and extended his hand—a shockingly informal gesture that made the courtiers gasp. 'Give me time, Monsieur. I promise I won't forget what you did for me. A Bourbon always pays his debts.'"
  vendee.10.c: "The promise cannot be broken"
  vendee.11.a: "The Oath"
  vendee.11.b: "The Champ de Mars stretches before the assembled thousands, transformed into an arena of national celebration. Tricolor banners flutter alongside white Bourbon flags—an uneasy marriage of old and new France. Military bands play as citizens from across the nation gather on this warm summer day, come to witness what Lafayette has promised will be 'the birth of a new French harmony.'\n\nThe Marquis de Lafayette, Regent of France, ascends the platform erected at the field's center. He still wears the tricolor cockade pinned to his coat—a detail that makes some Vendéen officers stiffen, but which draws cheers from the Parisian crowds. Behind him, a massive altar has been erected, though notably it bears both Catholic and civic symbols, another careful balance.\n\nLafayette raises his hand, and the multitude falls silent. His voice, trained by years of oratory, carries across the field:\n\n'I swear to be faithful to the Nation, to the Law, and to the King! I swear that as Regent, I shall exercise this sacred trust with virtue and justice! I swear that I shall govern not for Paris alone, nor for the Vendée alone, but for all France—that power shall flow from the people through their departments and communes, not be hoarded in palaces!'\n\nThe Federalist delegates applaud vigorously. The promise of decentralization is music to their ears—a France of federated regions, not Jacobin dictatorship or absolutist monarchy.\n\nBut then, cutting through the applause, a voice from the crowd: 'Murderer! You ordered the Champ de Mars massacre! How many Republicans died by your command?'\n\nThe field tenses. Guards move toward the heckler. But Lafayette raises his hand again, stopping them. He does not acknowledge the accusation directly, does not defend himself, does not order the man's arrest. Instead, he simply continues, as if the interruption were merely wind:\n\n'And now, let all France hear the oath of our sovereign, Louis XVII, King of the French!'\n\nHe gestures toward the VIP pavilion, where the young King sits. At thirteen, Louis XVII still bears the marks of his ordeal—he is small for his age, his face pale. But as he rises, there is dignity in his bearing. The child who wept in a Vendéen outpost has become something else through suffering.\n\nLouis XVII walks to the platform, his voice clear but soft:\n\n'I swear to respect and maintain the Constitution of France. I swear that the powers entrusted to me shall be used for the French people, not against them. I am Louis, King of the French—not King of France, but of the French people, who are sovereign.'\n\nThe words are Lafayette's, carefully crafted. But the boy speaks them with conviction. Perhaps he remembers the Temple Prison. Perhaps he understands that the crown survives only by adapting.\n\nFor a moment, the field is silent. Then, like a wave breaking, the cheers begin. Not universal—some Vendéens look troubled, some republicans remain stone-faced—but enough. Enough to suggest that perhaps, just perhaps, Lafayette's impossible dream of reconciliation might not be entirely mad."
  vendee.11.c: "I swear"
  vendee.12.a: "Question of Department"
  vendee.12.b: "Your alliance with the Federalists has borne fruit—together, you've rebuilt France from the ashes of civil war. But now comes the harder part: deciding what kind of France this will be.\n\nThe Federalists have requested a meeting to discuss the departmental system. You remember, of course, that the departments were a revolutionary creation—the National Assembly carved up France's ancient provinces in 1790, replacing centuries of tradition with geometric rationality. Vendée itself was once part of Poitou and Anjou; now it's just another numbered administrative unit.\n\nThe Federalist delegation enters your council chamber, led by men who once served in the Girondin assembly. They're pragmatists, these Federalists—they want order and law, but not the centralized tyranny of the Jacobins.\n\n'Your Majesty,' their spokesman begins, carefully choosing his words. 'We must address the departmental question. Some of your royalist advisors whisper of abolishing the departments entirely, of restoring the old provinces and their privileges. We urge caution.'\n\nHe spreads a map across your table. 'The departments may be a revolutionary creation, but they work. They're rational, efficient, and—crucially—they've broken the power of the old provincial nobility. Do you really want to restore the Parlements? The competing legal codes? The internal customs barriers that strangled commerce?'\n\nBut he acknowledges the other side too. 'That said, the Convention centralized too much power in Paris. Every local decision required approval from the Committee of Public Safety. That's how tyranny grows. We Federalists believe in local autonomy—departments should govern themselves, not merely take orders from the capital.'\n\nYour royalist advisors bristle at this. The Duc de La Rochefoucauld speaks up: 'The departments are abominations, Your Majesty. They erased a thousand years of French history. Brittany, Burgundy, Gascony—these are not mere administrative conveniences, but living communities with their own laws, customs, and loyalties. To keep the departments is to accept the Revolution's vandalism.'\n\nThe Federalist spokesman counters: 'And to restore the provinces is to resurrect the chaos that made 1789 inevitable. Your Majesty must choose: tradition or efficiency? Centralization or autonomy? The future of France's governance hangs in the balance.'\n\nYou consider your options carefully."

  vendee.13.a: "A Question of Propriety"
  vendee.13.b: "The afternoon sun filtered through the windows of the Palace as the Marquis de Lafayette stood before Louis XVII, delivering his weekly report. The young King, now showing the bearing of a monarch despite his youth, listened attentively as his regent detailed the state of the realm.\n\n'The protests in Lyon have subsided, Your Majesty,' Lafayette reported with cautious optimism. 'Trade is slowly resuming. The bread riots have decreased by half this month. The people begin to see that constitutional monarchy can provide both order and liberty.'\n\nLouis XVII nodded thoughtfully. 'And the military academies? You mentioned reforms?'\n\n'Indeed, Sire. Following the precedent set during the civil war, when necessity demanded that women take up arms alongside their brothers, I have opened enrollment at the preparatory military schools to qualified women. Those who proved themselves in battle deserve the opportunity to—'\n\nThe doors burst open with a crash that made both men turn sharply. General François de Charette strode in, his face flushed with fury, followed by several other conservative officers. The general had not even bothered to be announced.\n\n'This is an outrage!' Charette's voice thundered through the chamber. 'Women in military academies? Have you lost your senses, Lafayette? We fought to restore Christian civilization to France, not to perpetuate revolutionary madness!'\n\nLafayette's expression hardened. 'General, you forget yourself. This is the King's—'\n\n'I forget nothing!' Charette interrupted, advancing into the room. 'I remember who bled in the hedgerows of the Vendée while you philosophized in your American estate! I remember who—'\n\nHe stopped abruptly, finally noticing Louis XVII rising from his seat. The general's face went pale. He and his officers immediately dropped to one knee, fists over hearts.\n\n'Your Majesty,' Charette said, his voice now controlled but still passionate. 'Forgive my intrusion, but this matter could not wait. The Marquis oversteps his authority. Women bearing arms, studying military science—it violates every principle of natural order and Christian teaching.'\n\nThe room fell silent. All eyes turned to the young King. Louis XVII was only fourteen, but his childhood in the Temple Prison had aged him beyond his years. When he spoke, his voice was quiet but carried absolute authority.\n\n'General de Charette,' Louis began, his tone measured. 'I have not forgotten that you fought for my freedom when I had no one else. Your loyalty is beyond question.'\n\nCharette's face brightened with hope. 'Then Your Majesty will dismiss—'\n\n'I have not finished, General.' The quiet rebuke silenced the room. 'The Marquis de Lafayette serves as my regent with my full confidence. The policies he implements are done with my knowledge and consent.'\n\n'But Sire,' Charette protested, rising slightly, 'women in the army, it's... it's unnatural! It's—'\n\n'During my imprisonment,' Louis interrupted, his voice now carrying an edge of cold steel, 'I learned that "natural order" and "tradition" were the words my captors used to justify every cruelty. They said it was "natural" that I should suffer for my father's sins. That "tradition" demanded the extermination of my family.'\n\nThe King stepped forward, and despite his youth and slight frame, every man in the room felt the weight of his presence.\n\n'I remember being rescued, General. I remember women of the Vendée who risked their lives to save mine. I remember Madame de Bonchamps who dressed my wounds. I remember the girl—she could not have been more than sixteen—who stood guard outside my hiding place with a musket, prepared to die so that I might live.'\n\nLouis XVII's eyes met Charette's directly. 'Tell me, General, by what logic do we honor these women as heroes of the Vendée, yet deny them the right to continue serving France in peace as they did in war?'\n\nCharette opened his mouth, closed it, then opened it again. No words came. The other conservative officers shifted uncomfortably.\n\n'The Marquis de Lafayette,' Louis continued, 'has my complete trust. His reforms proceed with my blessing. If you cannot serve under these conditions, General, I will accept your resignation with honor and gratitude. But I will not dismiss a man who has served France faithfully across two continents and three decades.'\n\nThe silence stretched. Charette's jaw worked as if he wanted to argue, but the steel in the young King's eyes—eyes that had seen horrors these generals could barely imagine—made further protest impossible.\n\nFinally, Charette bowed deeply. 'Your Majesty's will is absolute. I... I spoke in haste. Forgive me.'\n\n'There is nothing to forgive, General. Your concern for France's soul does you credit.' Louis XVII's expression softened slightly. 'But understand this: France's soul was nearly destroyed by those who claimed to know what was "natural" and "proper." I will not rebuild this nation on the same foundations that allowed such evil to flourish.'\n\nCharette and his officers bowed again and withdrew, their footsteps echoing in the hall. When they were gone, Lafayette let out a breath he hadn't realized he'd been holding.\n\n'Your Majesty,' he said quietly, 'that was... remarkably handled.'\n\nLouis XVII returned to his seat, suddenly looking very young and very tired. 'I meant every word, Marquis. But...' he glanced toward the door, 'how many more like Charette remain in the army?'\n\nLafayette's expression grew troubled. 'More than I would like, Sire. Far more than I would like.'"

  vendee.100.d:0 "A courier from Vienna arrived at court bearing unexpected news—and an unexpected prisoner. The Austrians, having held the Marquis de Lafayette in their fortress at Olmütz for years, have decided his fate is no longer their concern. With characteristic Habsburg pragmatism, they have transferred the famous general to Vendéen custody, washing their hands of a man who embarrasses all sides.\n\nGilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, now stands in chains before the court of the young King he once served—and whose family he failed to save. The 'Hero of Two Worlds' who fought for American liberty and French reform now appears gaunt and aged, his revolutionary ideals having led to nothing but terror and tyranny.\n\nThe constitutional monarchists see an opportunity. Lafayette championed a British-style monarchy with the King as a symbolic figurehead—precisely what they envision for France's future. His prestige, especially with the Americans, could legitimize a moderate settlement. 'He made mistakes,' they argue, 'but he tried to save Louis XVI. He fled the Jacobins just as we did.'\n\nThe absolutists are incensed. 'This man stripped your father of his powers!' they remind the King. 'He commanded the mob that imprisoned the Royal Family at the Tuileries! His constitutional fantasies paved the road to the guillotine! He is a traitor who deserves a traitor's death!'\n\nThe Federalist advisors offer a middle path: clemency in exchange for public service. Lafayette's military expertise and international connections could prove valuable, and mercy would demonstrate that constitutional monarchy is not vengeance.\n\nLouis XVII studies the prisoner in silence. Here stands the man who once swore to protect the Royal Family, who commanded the National Guard that failed to stop the Revolution's descent into madness. The King remembers his father's letters, which spoke of Lafayette with both disappointment and a strange, persistent hope that the Marquis might yet prove loyal.\n\nWhat justice does Lafayette deserve? The answer will define what kind of monarchy France shall become."

These are the men who had cheered at the guillotine, who had voted for the King's father's death, who had ordered the drownings at Nantes and the columns infernales through the Vendée. Some are unrepentant ideologues, still muttering about liberty and virtue even in their cells. Others are broken men, begging for mercy they never showed their own victims.\n\nThe court demands blood for blood. Families who lost fathers, sons, and daughters in the Vendée massacres cry out for justice. The Catholic bishops speak of righteous punishment for crimes against God and man. Even moderate voices acknowledge that some accountability must be demanded.\n\nYet Louis XVII has seen enough of revolutionary 'justice'—the mock trials, the tumbrels rolling toward the scaffold, the cheering crowds. He knows what it means to be helpless before judges who have already decided your guilt. The question haunts him in quiet moments... if he orders mass executions, how is he different from them?\n\nThree paths lie before the young King. He can exile the Jacobin leadership, scattering them across Europe as living warnings but avoiding further bloodshed. He can offer a general amnesty, drawing a line under the past and seeking reconciliation—a radical mercy that would shock both his own supporters and foreign courts. Or he can give the people what they demand. trials, sentences, and the justice of the scaffold.\n\nThe Vendéen veterans who saved him from the Temple watch him carefully, waiting to see what kind of king the boy they rescued will become."

  vendee.200.d: "The great hall of the Vendéen headquarters falls silent as guards drag the prisoner forward. Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette—once called the 'Hero of Two Worlds'—now stands in chains before a tribunal of royalist officers and Catholic clergy. The Austrians, having tired of housing this embarrassment, have delivered him into Vendéen hands with a simple message: 'Do with him as you please.'\n\nThe charges are read aloud, each one met with growls of anger from the assembled loyalists. Treason against the Crown. Complicity in the imprisonment of the Royal Family. Commanding the forces that failed—or refused—to protect Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. Propagating the poisonous doctrines of constitutional monarchy that weakened the throne and enabled the Jacobin terror.\n\n'I served France,' Lafayette protests weakly. 'I tried to save the King. I fled the Revolution when it turned to madness—'\n\n'You created that madness!' an officer shouts. 'Your American ideals, your National Assembly, your constitutional fantasies—all of it led to the guillotine! The King's blood is on your hands as surely as if you wielded the blade yourself!'\n\nThe prosecution presents damning evidence: Lafayette's letters advocating limits on royal power, his orders to the National Guard during the October Days when the mob dragged the Royal Family from Versailles, his failure to prevent the flight to Varennes from becoming a disaster. Most damningly, they read his pamphlets calling for a monarchy 'restrained by law'—words that sound like blasphemy in this room of absolute monarchists.\n\nYet even here, some voices counsel caution. An elderly nobleman notes that Lafayette was imprisoned by the very revolutionaries he supposedly served—proof that even the Jacobins saw him as an enemy. A priest reminds the court that vengeance belongs to God, and that mercy is a kingly virtue. A pragmatic general suggests that executing a man famous in America and England might damage Vendée's hopes for foreign recognition and support.\n\nBut the civil war still rages. Republican armies still burn churches and murder priests across France. The traumatized young King, scarred by years of revolutionary brutality, must decide: Does Lafayette deserve the mercy he failed to show the Royal Family? Or does justice demand that this architect of revolution face the same fate he helped bring upon his King?"

It is a monument to rebellion, a temple of regicide, the birthplace of France's nightmare.\n\nYet some pragmatic advisors argue the institution might be preserved in neutered form—an advisory body with no real power, maintaining the appearance of consultation while the King rules as his ancestors did. 'Let them debate and advise,' one minister suggests, 'but give them no authority to constrain Your Majesty.'\n\nOthers, driven by righteous fury and memories of the Terror, demand harsher measures. 'The very men who sat in those seats voted for your father's death, Your Majesty,' a hardline royalist whispers. 'They cheered when the Queen went to the scaffold. They starved you in darkness as a child. The Assembly must not merely be dissolved—its members must answer for their crimes. Root and branch, every last one.'\n\nLouis XVII stands before a window overlooking the gardens, his back to his councilors. His hands are clasped behind him, white-knuckled. The scars of the Temple Prison still mark his soul, and these men ask him to decide the fate of those who created that hell.\n\nThe young King's decision will set the tone for his entire reign.

But in the dungeons of reclaimed fortresses and requisitioned buildings, another group awaits judgment—the Federalists.\n\nThese men had been enemies of the Jacobins, opponents of Robespierre's tyranny. Some had even offered aid during the darkest days of the war. But they had also been revolutionaries once, men who had voted for a Republic, who had supported the overthrow of Louis XVI. Their hands, too, were stained with the crime of regicide—if not by direct vote, then by complicity in the system that murdered a King.\n\nLouis XVII, now showing signs of recovery from his childhood ordeal, has grown into a young man of quiet intensity. The haunted look never quite leaves his eyes, but his mind is sharp and his will growing stronger each day. When his advisors present the Federalist question, he listens carefully to all sides.\n\nThe hardline royalists demand blood. 'They are republicans, Your Majesty,' declares the Comte de Charette. 'They supported the Revolution. They may have turned against the Jacobins, but only when the Terror threatened them personally. They would have been content to let France remain a republic. They must face justice.'\n\nOthers counsel pragmatism. 'The Federalists control significant territories, Sire,' explains a senior minister. 'Many are skilled administrators, military officers, men of education. To execute them all would create martyrs and deprive France of talent she desperately needs. We have already lost so many...'\n\nThe Catholic clergy urges mercy. 'Our Lord taught forgiveness, Your Majesty. These men have renounced the Jacobin madness. Some have already sworn loyalty to the Crown. If we show mercy, we demonstrate that royal justice is superior to revolutionary vengeance.'\n\nLouis XVII sits in silence for a long moment, his fingers tracing the scars on his wrists—reminders of shackles worn in childhood.

  vendee.9.a: "Bitter past"
  vendee.9.b: "The morning sun cast long shadows across the grounds of Versailles as the young King pursued his daily ritual. Louis XVII, dressed in simple riding clothes rather than royal regalia, practiced swordsmanship against a training post with remarkable energy for a boy who had spent years in darkness. His tutor watched from a respectful distance as he moved with surprising grace—parrying, lunging, laughing when he stumbled.\n\n'Your Majesty fights well,' came a voice from behind. 'Though your footwork needs attention.'\n\nLouis XVII spun around, wooden practice sword still raised, to see a tall figure in a general's uniform approaching. The tricolor cockade pinned prominently to his hat caught the boy's eye immediately—that hated symbol of the Revolution. The young King's playful expression vanished, replaced by something colder, more guarded.\n\n'Monsieur de Lafayette,' Louis XVII said quietly, lowering his sword but not sheathing it. His voice carried an edge that seemed too mature for his years. 'My regent, I am told. The hero of America. The champion of liberty.' A pause. 'The man my father said betrayed him.'\n\nLafayette stopped several paces away and removed his hat, bowing deeply. When he straightened, his weathered face showed no anger at the accusation—only profound sadness.\n\n'Your Majesty speaks the truth his father knew,' Lafayette replied softly. 'Louis XVI did feel betrayed by me. And perhaps... perhaps he was not wrong to feel so.'\n\nThe boy tilted his head, curiosity breaking through his defensive posture. 'You admit it?'\n\n'I admit that I failed him, Sire.' Lafayette moved closer, his hands open and empty. 'Your father was a good man—better than most who wore crowns. Kind. Thoughtful. He cared deeply for France and for his family.' His voice caught slightly. 'When the Revolution began, I believed... I believed we could have both. A king and liberty. Your father on his throne, but France with a constitution, with rights, with laws that bound even monarchs.'\n\nLouis XVII's grip on his practice sword loosened slightly. 'Maman spoke of you sometimes. In the Temple. Before they... before...' He couldn't finish.\n\n'I know, Your Majesty.' Lafayette knelt on one knee, bringing himself to eye level with the boy. 'I failed them both. When the mob came to Versailles in 1789, I commanded the National Guard, but I could not control them. When your father tried to flee to Varennes, I was the one who helped capture him—because I still believed, foolishly, that we could preserve both throne and constitution. And when the Jacobins seized power, when Robespierre's Terror began...' His voice hardened. 'I fled to Austria rather than face the guillotine. I was imprisoned there while your family suffered. I was not there to protect you.'\n\nThe young King stared at him, his expression unreadable—that stubborn silence his governess had warned Lafayette about, the way the boy retreated into himself when confronted.\n\nLafayette continued, his voice thick with emotion. 'Your Majesty has every right to hate me. Your father died believing I betrayed him. Your mother went to the scaffold while I sat in an Austrian cell. And you—' His composure finally cracked. 'You were tortured by the very Revolution I helped begin. The ideals I championed were twisted into weapons used against a child. How can I ask your forgiveness for that?'\n\nFor a long moment, silence hung between them. A bird sang somewhere in the gardens. The breeze rustled through the trees.\n\nThen Louis XVII did something unexpected. He dropped his practice sword and sat down on the grass—an utterly un-regal gesture that made his watching tutor gasp. He patted the ground beside him.\n\n'Sit with me, Monsieur,' the boy said quietly. 'Not as regent and king. Just... sit.'\n\nLafayette, surprised, lowered himself to sit cross-legged beside the young King.\n\n'Maman told me something,' Louis XVII said, pulling at the grass absently. 'In the Temple, before they took her away. She said that people who make mistakes aren't always bad people. That Papa made mistakes too—trusted the wrong advisors, waited too long to act. She said...' His voice became very small. 'She said the hardest thing in the world is to do what you think is right when everyone around you is doing wrong.'\n\nHe looked up at Lafayette with eyes that had seen far too much for twelve years. 'You tried to save Papa and still keep France from drowning in blood. You failed. But Simon the cobbler didn't fail—he meant to hurt me, and he did. The Jacobins didn't fail—they wanted to kill my family, and they succeeded.' A tremor ran through the boy's voice. 'You failed because you tried to save everyone. They succeeded because they wanted to destroy.'\n\nLafayette found his vision blurring. 'Your Majesty is... remarkably wise for one so young.'\n\n'I'm not wise,' the boy said with sudden fierceness, his stubborn streak emerging. 'I just... I remember the dark. I remember the cold. I remember thinking that everyone in the world wanted me dead.' He turned to look directly at Lafayette. 'You're wearing that tricolor cockade—the symbol of the Revolution—and yet you Still loyal to me. Why?'\n\n'Because, Your Majesty,' Lafayette said softly, touching the cockade on his hat, 'this does not mean what Robespierre made it mean. This is not a symbol of terror and murder. This is the symbol of the idea that all men are born free and equal—including kings. That power must be tempered by law. That France belongs to all her people, not just to nobles or radicals.' He met the boy's gaze steadily. 'I wear this because I still believe in those ideals. But I kneel before you because I believe a nation needs both—liberty AND order. Rights AND responsibility. A king who respects his people, and people who respect their king.'\n\nLouis XVII considered this seriously, then suddenly his face broke into a grin—the playful child emerging again. 'So you want me to be a king who follows rules? Even when I don't want to?'\n\nLafayette couldn't help but smile back. 'Especially when you don't want to, Sire.'\n\n'That sounds boring,' the boy said, but his eyes were twinkling. Then, more seriously: 'Monsieur de Lafayette, I cannot forgive you for Papa and Maman. That hurt is... it's too big. Not yet.' His voice dropped to a whisper. 'But maybe... maybe someday I can. If you help me understand. If you teach me how to be the kind of king who doesn't make people want to cut off heads.'\n\n'I would be honored to try, Your Majesty,' Lafayette said, bowing his head.\n\nThe boy stood up suddenly, bouncing on his toes with recovered energy. 'Good! Then you can start by teaching me proper footwork. You said mine was terrible.'\n\n'I said it needed attention, Sire.'\n\n'Same thing!' Louis XVII laughed—a clear, genuine sound that seemed to surprise even himself. 'Come on, Monsieur le Régent. Show me how Americans fight.'\n\nAs Lafayette rose and picked up the practice sword, showing the eager young King the proper stance, both knew that the road ahead would be difficult. France was broken. The people were angry. Foreign armies occupied French soil. But in that moment, in the gardens of Versailles, there was something that hadn't existed in France for years: hope.\n\nA hope that perhaps this time, they could build something that would last. A France with both a crown and a constitution. A king who had known suffering and might therefore rule with compassion. And a regent who had failed once, but might yet succeed in creating the nation he had always dreamed of—one where liberty and monarchy could coexist.\n\nThe young King laughed again as he attempted a lunge and nearly fell. Lafayette caught him, steadying him.\n\n'Again, Sire?'\n\n'Again!' Louis XVII declared cheerfully. 'And this time I won't fall. Probably.'"

  vendee.14.b: "The following letter was intercepted by royal postal inspectors conducting routine checks for seditious correspondence. Finding nothing treasonous, they forwarded it to the regent's office as an example of public sentiment. It was written by one Jean-Baptiste Moreau, a farmer from a village near Cholet in the Vendée:\n\n'My dearest brother Claude,\n\nI write to you in Marseille with news that you will scarcely believe, for I can hardly believe it myself. The salt tax—that ancient curse that has plagued our family for generations—is gone. Abolished! By order of the King and his regent, the Marquis de Lafayette.\n\nI know what you are thinking, for I thought it myself: another empty promise from versailles, another lie from those who rule us. But Claude, it is real. Last week, I walked into Cholet with Papa's old cart and bought a full sack of salt—good white salt, not the gray contraband we used to hide in the cellar. And do you know what I paid? Less than half what we paid under the Republic! No tax. No inspectors demanding papers. No threat of the gallows for a pinch of salt.\n\nMaman wept when I brought it home. She actually wept over a sack of salt.\n\nBut that is not all, brother. The markets are full again. Real full, not the empty stalls we saw during the Terror when they promised equality but gave us starvation. Yesterday I sold two pigs at prices I have not seen since before the Revolution—and in coin that actually holds its value, not those worthless assignats that the Republic printed like wastepaper.\n\nThe English ships have returned to Nantes. Spanish merchants cross the Pyrenees again. Even the roads are being repaired—can you imagine? They are filling the holes that have been there since I was a boy!\n\nI know you still believe in the Republic, Claude. I know you think we sold France to kings and foreigners. And yes, the Prussians still occupy Paris—that shame burns in my chest too. But brother, I must tell you the truth as I see it with my own eyes:\n\nUnder the Republic, they promised us liberty and gave us the guillotine. They promised us equality and took everything we had. They promised us fraternity and set neighbor against neighbor. My family starved while Jacobins in Paris spoke of virtue.\n\nNow? Now I can buy salt without fear. I can sell my harvest without some committee of public safety confiscating it "for the people." My daughter goes to school—yes, a real school, not just for boys anymore—and learns to read and write. The church bells ring again on Sunday, and no one is arrested for attending Mass.\n\nI know we will never agree on politics. You still dream of Robespierre's Republic of Virtue. I dream of keeping my family alive and fed. Perhaps that makes me a simple man, unworthy of the grand ideals you cherish.\n\nBut tonight, when I sit at my table with bread—real bread, not the sawdust mixture we ate during the famine—and sprinkle it with salt that cost me no tax and risked me no punishment, I will think of you. And I will hope that someday you can return to Vendée and see with your own eyes what I see:\n\nA France that is not perfect, but is finally, finally healing.\n\nYour brother always,\n\nJean-Baptiste"

In the Hall of Mirrors, where his grandfather had once received the homage of Europe's greatest powers, Louis XVII sat with his regent, the Marquis de Lafayette, reviewing matters of state.\n\n'Your Majesty,' Lafayette began, setting down a stack of papers, 'there is one matter of symbolic importance we have neglected. France needs a national anthem—a song that represents your reign and unifies the nation.'\n\nThe young King, now sixteen and increasingly taking active interest in governance, leaned forward with curiosity. 'What do you propose, Marquis?'\n\nLafayette unfolded three sheets of music. 'The committee has selected three candidates, each with its own merits and... complications.'\n\nHe placed the first sheet forward. 'The March of Henry IV—"Vive Henri Quatre." A traditional royalist anthem, celebrating the first Bourbon king who united France and ended the religious wars. It speaks of legitimate authority and historical continuity.'\n\nLouis XVII nodded slowly, his expression thoughtful but noncommittal.\n\nLafayette presented the second option. 'Vive Louis XVI, notre bon Roi—a song created during your father's reign, celebrating the monarchy and traditional values. Many of the Vendéen veterans favor this choice, as it honors your martyred father's memory.'\n\nThe King's face tightened almost imperceptibly at the mention of his father. Lafayette noticed but continued.\n\n'And the third...' Lafayette hesitated, his expression bewildered, 'is La Marseillaise.'\n\nThe silence that followed was profound. Lafayette stared at the sheet music as if it might explode.\n\n'Marquis,' he continued, his voice carefully controlled, 'I must confess I am... perplexed as to how this particular selection made it through the committee. This is the anthem of the Republic. The song that accompanied the armies that destroyed the monarchy, that...' he trailed off, glancing at Louis XVII with concern.\n\n'That killed my family,' Louis finished quietly. 'I know what it is, Marquis.'\n\n'Then surely Your Majesty understands why this is—'\n\n'I know exactly why it is on this list,' Louis interrupted, rising from his seat and walking to the great windows overlooking the gardens. 'And I suspect you do too, if you would admit it.'\n\nLafayette remained silent, waiting.\n\nLouis XVII continued, his back still to his regent, his voice measured but edged with something harder. 'Paris remains under Prussian occupation. Their soldiers parade past the Louvre daily. Calais flies the Union Jack. British customs officers tax French merchants in a French port. And Strasbourg...' his voice grew bitter, 'Strasbourg is divided like a spoil of war between Austria and Prussia.'\n\nHe turned to face Lafayette, and the regent was struck by how the young King's eyes seemed to hold decades more experience than his years.\n\n'Do you know what the people sing in the streets, Marquis? Not hymns to the Bourbons. Not prayers of thanks for their liberation from the Terror. They sing La Marseillaise. They sing "Aux armes, citoyens!" They sing of foreign tyrants and the blood of patriots watering French soil.'\n\nLafayette shifted uncomfortably. 'Your Majesty, that song was—'\n\n'Was written to inspire Frenchmen to defend France from foreign invasion,' Louis interrupted. 'And now France is invaded. Occupied. Humiliated. The people do not care that it was a revolutionary anthem. They care that it speaks to their rage at seeing Prussian boots on Parisian streets and English ships in French harbors.'\n\nThe King walked slowly back to the table, his fingers trailing across the three sheets of music.\n\n'The March of Henry IV speaks of the past—of a France that no longer exists and perhaps never truly did. Vive Louis XVI...' he paused, his jaw tightening, 'honors a king who was murdered, a system that failed, a world that burned.'\n\nHe picked up the sheet of La Marseillaise, studying it with an expression Lafayette could not quite read.\n\n'But this,' Louis continued softly, 'this speaks to the France that exists now. Wounded. Angry. Proud despite everything. A France that will not accept foreign occupation, regardless of who sits on the throne.'\n\nLafayette took a careful breath. 'Your Majesty, if you choose that song, every royalist in France will see it as a betrayal. The Vendéen veterans, the émigrés who returned, the nobles who supported your restoration—'\n\n'Will have to understand,' Louis said firmly, 'that I am not king of the émigrés or the Vendée alone. I am King of France. All of France. Including the parts that still sing revolutionary songs because those songs speak to truths that monarchy ignored for too long.'\n\nHe set down La Marseillaise and looked at Lafayette directly."

  vendee.16.a: "To arm?"
  vendee.16.b: "Lord Pierre was quick to get out of the carriage, it was one of those days when he was tired of the workers' problems running the factory, thinking angrily about how his managers were not following his orders. The cold wind brushed his face as he walked through the gardens of his elegant and classic chateau, the one he saw every day and it did not surprise him, in his mind only that cloudy day stood out. When he opened the doors he saw that lunch was already ready, and he went to the dining room with his family who were already seated. Shortly after greeting them, he stuck his fork into the steak. "Good afternoon darling, have you heard there's a new hymn?" his wife said while chewing meat. "A new anthem...?" Pierre pressed his fingers to the fork, although he had not heard it before, he instinctively knew that it was a decree from the regent, he always had a bad feeling about that man. "And which one is it?" "La Marsillaise, Pope, the one that the Jacobins sang in the revolution, it is clear that the king is being manipulated by those liberal bastards!" His teenage son took issue with the anthem aggressively, while he was still cutting the steak. His mother pitied the king's opponents more. "Son, the peasants and the burgesses must be appeased somehow, they would have thrown out the king a long time ago." "So, we should kill all the peasants who oppose the king, instead of letting Freemasons into the government." The daughter commented, defending her little brother. "This guy Lafayette increasingly puts measures against the aristocracy and therefore against us." "So, we should kill all the peasants who oppose the king, instead of letting Freemasons into the government." The daughter commented, defending her little brother. "This guy Lafayette increasingly puts measures against the aristocracy and therefore against us." "Daughter, you can't think about killing people for thinking the opposite of you." His mother argued. "But then they will destroy our family and our class, we must not give peace to the poor who are envious of us!" The son defended. Pierre continued chewing his steak while listening in the background to his family arguing with louder voices with each answer, he thought, he remembered how his companions and almost friends died under the songs of the Marseillaise just because of their economic status or titles. He remembered that he was beaten multiple times by Jacobins for walking down the street without protection. He brushed against death once, dodging a miracle shot from a revolutionary's gun. And now the national anthem became which used to represent people who hated the king and his kind. He was a proud conservative and it pained him that the regency government was increasingly hostile towards the nobility, favoring the populace. "My desire to eat has gone away." Pierre stood up, leaving the steak almost untouched, only eating two pieces. And he walked out of the room, leaving his wife and children baffled by his reaction. Pierre went up to his private study and began to write."
  vendee.16.c: "A house divided."
  vendee.17.a: "A Promise at Versailles."
  vendee.17.b: "The Palace of Versailles, once the glittering heart of royal power, stands scarred by years of revolutionary neglect. Looters stripped its gilt furnishings. Vandals defaced its paintings. The Hall of Mirrors, where Louis XIV once held court before all Europe, now echoes with emptiness. Yet it is here, in this wounded monument to Bourbon glory, that uncle and nephew finally meet.\n\nLouis Stanislas Xavier—now styled Louis XVIII in recognition of his deceased older brother and the martyred boy's father—arrives in the throne room with measured dignity. At fifty-nine years old, corpulent and walking with difficulty due to gout, he nevertheless maintains the bearing of a king. He has waited years in exile for this moment, dreaming of restoration while living on foreign charity.\n\nLouis XVII rises from his chair—still too large for his slight frame—as his uncle approaches. The boy is twelve now, thin and pale, bearing the invisible scars of the Temple Prison. For a moment, uncle and nephew simply regard each other: the old man who spent the Terror in comfortable exile, and the child who endured its darkest horrors.\n\nThen Louis XVIII's careful composure cracks. Tears stream down his face as he kneels—knees protesting—before his young sovereign.\n\n'My King,' he whispers. 'My nephew. My poor child. What they did to you... what they did to all of us...'\n\nLouis XVII reaches out tentatively, placing a small hand on his uncle's shoulder. The gesture seems to break something in both of them. The older man embraces the boy, and for long moments they simply hold each other—two survivors of a family nearly destroyed, two remnants of a world that died in blood.\n\nWhen they finally separate, Louis XVIII wipes his eyes and speaks with formal gravity, though his voice still trembles.\n\n'Your Majesty, I served your father loyally, though I could not save him. I failed your mother, may God rest her soul. I was not there when you needed protection most. But I am here now.' He takes the boy's hands in his own. 'I swear before God and on the honor of our house: I shall serve as your regent with absolute faithfulness. I shall guard your throne until you are ready to claim it fully. I shall restore what the Revolution destroyed, and I shall ensure that when you come of age, you inherit a France worthy of the name Bourbon.'\n\nThe young King looks at his uncle with eyes older than his years—eyes that have seen too much darkness.\n\n'I trust you, Uncle,' Louis XVII says quietly. 'France needs wisdom now. She needs healing. She needs... someone who remembers what she was, before all this.'\n\nLouis XVIII nods gravely. 'France shall have her restoration, Your Majesty. This I promise you. The regicides will answer for their crimes. The émigré nobility will return to their rightful places. The Church will reclaim her authority. And the madness of equality and revolution will be buried forever.'\n\nHe does not notice the flicker of uncertainty that crosses his nephew's face at those words—a boy who suffered not from revolutionary ideals but from revolutionary cruelty, who cannot quite separate the two, who wonders if restoration means healing or merely revenge.\n\nBut Louis XVIII has made his promise, and he intends to keep it."
  vendee.17.c: "I miss you."
  vendee.18.a: "Election Result"
  vendee.18.b: "The Café Procope in Paris(france district) buzzes with unprecedented energy. At corner tables throughout the establishment, men lean close over wine and coffee, voices rising and falling in passionate debate. Similar scenes play out in taverns across France—in Lyon, Bordeaux, Marseille, even in occupied Strasbourg where Prussian officers watch nervously from their own establishments.\n\n'He actually did it,' a merchant mutters, shaking his head in disbelief. 'Lafayette called for elections to a National Assembly. A real Assembly, not some royal puppet show.'\n\n'My brother in Nantes says the Girondins are sweeping the Atlantic ports,' a young lawyer adds, shuffling through newspapers. 'All that talk about federalism, commercial liberty, constitutional monarchy—people are eating it up.'\n\nAn older gentleman in Feuillant colors scoffs. 'We had the early lead. The moderate royalists, the constitutional conservatives—we were positioned perfectly. Then those damned Federalist provinces started reporting their counts...'\n\n'The Prussians in Paris certainly helped your cause slip,' someone jokes darkly. Several men don't laugh.\n\nA well-dressed nobleman at another table speaks loudly enough to be heard. 'The Count of Artois's candidates did respectably. Third place is nothing to dismiss. The people haven't forgotten that we need order, tradition, a firm hand—'\n\n'Third place is still third place, Monsieur,' a voice interrupts. 'And Monsieur Louis XVIII's Doctrinaires took fourth. The so-called moderate royalists split the vote between you.'\n\nIn the darkest corner, a group of men in workers' clothes sits in bitter silence. One finally speaks: 'Fifth. We came in fifth. The Jacobins—defenders of the Revolution, the true voice of the people—fifth place.'\n\n'Perhaps because you kept screaming about liberating Paris from the Prussians while offering no actual plan to do so,' the merchant observes dryly. 'People want bread and jobs, not another war we'd lose.'\n\n'We tried to remind them!' the Jacobin hisses. 'Paris—occupied! Calais—English! Strasbourg—divided like butchered meat! And what does Lafayette do? Holds elections! As if voting will drive out foreign soldiers!'\n\n'And yet you lost,' the lawyer notes. 'The people heard your message. They rejected it.'\n\nThe barkeeper calls for order as voices rise. Someone unfurls a newspaper with the official results:\n\n**FINAL SEAT COUNT - NATIONAL ASSEMBLY**\n\n**Girondins (Federalist-Republicans): 198 seats**\n**Feuillants (Constitutional Monarchists): 156 seats**  \n**Ultra-Royalists (Legitimist Faction): 94 seats**\n**Doctrinaires (Moderate Royalists): 71 seats**\n**Jacobins (Radical Republicans): 31 seats**\n\n'The Girondins will need a coalition,' the Feuillant observes. 'One hundred ninety-eight isn't a majority. They'll come to us.'\n\n'Or the Doctrinaires,' the nobleman suggests. 'A centrist alliance.'\n\n'God help us if they turn to the Ultra-Royalists or Jacobins,' someone mutters.\n\nThe Jacobin stands abruptly, throwing coins on the table. 'Thirty-one seats. Thirty-one! The party of Robespierre and Marat reduced to this. But revolutions don't die in ballot boxes, citizens. They die only when the people stop believing.'\n\nHe storms out. The remaining patrons exchange uncomfortable glances.\n\n'Well,' the merchant finally says, 'at least we're voting instead of killing each other. For now.'\n\nOutside, across France, the people await Lafayette's next move. The Assembly is elected. The coalition must be formed. The Regent must decide which factions to embrace and which to exclude. The young King watches from the Tuileries, learning what kind of kingdom he will inherit.\n\nThe age of absolute monarchy is over. But what comes next?"
  vendee.18.c: "The girodin is victory"
  vendee.19.a: "The Constitution"
  vendee.19.b: "The 'Trois Couronnes' tavern in Lyon's Croix-Rousse district had always been a place where men spoke freely—perhaps too freely. Tonight, the air was thick with tobacco smoke, cheap wine, and dangerous conversation. In a corner booth, five men huddled over a crumpled newspaper, their voices low but heated.\n\n'Listen to this,' muttered Jacques, a former Jacobin who now worked the silk looms. He read aloud from the official proclamation: 'His Majesty Louis XVIII, Regent of France, does hereby grant a Constitutional Charter to the French people...'\n\n'Grant?' spat Michel, a veteran of the revolutionary armies. 'GRANT? As if our rights are his to give! We took those rights in '89! We bled for them!'\n\n'Let him finish,' urged Pierre, a lawyer who had survived the Terror by keeping his head down. Jacques continued reading: 'Equality before the law... freedom of religion... freedom of the press within limits... a bicameral legislature... the King retains executive power and may dissolve the Chamber...'\n\n'Within limits,' sneered Michel. 'There's always limits with these people.'\n\nBut old Bertrand, who had fought in the Vendée on the royal side, shook his head. 'You don't understand. This is victory. The Regent could have restored everything—the feudal dues, the lettres de cachet, the corvée. Instead, he's accepting that France has changed. He's legitimizing what you fought for, even if he wraps it in royal language.'\n\n'Legitimizing?' Michel's face reddened. 'He's neutering it! The Charter preserves the Concordat, returns land to émigré nobles, guarantees their pensions while we starve! And the franchise—only those who pay 300 francs in taxes can vote! That's maybe one man in a hundred!'\n\n'One in a hundred is more than zero,' Pierre interjected carefully. 'And the Chamber can propose laws, control the budget. If we're patient—'\n\n'Patient!' Michel slammed his cup down. 'My son died at Valmy for the Republic! And now we're supposed to be grateful that some Bourbon parasite, propped up by Prussian bayonets, graciously allows us to beg for scraps?'\n\nYoung Henri, barely twenty, who had been silent until now, spoke up nervously. 'But... isn't it better than war? My village lost half its men. The farms are ruins. If this Charter means peace, even imperfect peace...'\n\n'Peace?' Michel laughed bitterly. 'There's no peace here, boy. Just an intermission. Mark my words—this Charter is written on paper, and paper burns. When the time comes, we'll finish what we started.'\n\nBertrand sighed heavily. 'Or perhaps the Charter saves us from that. Perhaps it's the bridge between the old world and the new. Perhaps Louis-Stanislas actually understands that France cannot go backward.'\n\n'Then why isn't young Louis XVII signing this Charter himself?' Jacques asked quietly. 'Why does his uncle rule in his name? What kind of restoration is this, really?'\n\nThe question hung in the air, unanswered. Outside, church bells rang—the same bells that once rang for the Republic now rang for the King. Through the tavern window, they could see royal soldiers patrolling, and beyond them, the tricolor still secretly painted on a few shuttered windows."

  vendee.20.b: "MINISTRY OF INTERIOR - CONFIDENTIAL REPORT\nTo: His Royal Highness Louis XVIII, Regent of France\nFrom: Inspector-General Dubois, Paris Prefecture\nDate: 15 March 1795\nClassification: MOST SECRET\n\nYour Royal Highness,\n\nIt is my duty to inform you of a development requiring immediate attention. The Marquis de Lafayette has formally registered a political organization under the name 'Liberal Party' (Parti Libéral) at the Paris municipal offices this morning.\n\nThe party's founding manifesto, attached herewith, calls for:\n- Constitutional monarchy with an elected legislative assembly\n- Abolition of feudal privileges and titles of nobility\n- Freedom of press and assembly\n- Universal male suffrage\n- Separation of Church and State\n- Trial by jury for all citizens\n\nOur agents report that Lafayette has already secured financial backing from wealthy merchants and former Girondin deputies. Membership applications number in the thousands across Paris, Lyon, and Bordeaux. Notable supporters include General Dumouriez, Benjamin Constant, and Madame de Staël.\n\nLafayette gave a speech yesterday at the Palais-Royal to a crowd of approximately 4,000 persons. He spoke of 'reconciling the crown with liberty' and 'healing France through constitutional government.' The crowd's response was enthusiastic. Disturbingly, several junior army officers were observed in attendance wearing tricolor cockades.\n\nLegal assessment: Under current law, the registration cannot be denied without cause. However, the party's platform directly contradicts His Majesty's restoration decrees. The Coalition ambassadors have expressed alarm—the Austrian minister called it 'Jacobinism in silk gloves.'\n\nYour Royal Highness must decide how to respond. The Ministry of Interior awaits your instructions.\n\nI remain your humble and obedient servant,\nInspector-General Dubois\n\nP.S. - Lafayette was seen dining with the Prussian ambassador last evening. The significance of this meeting remains unclear."

  vendee.21.b: "Louis XVIII, serving as regent for his young nephew, has proven himself more than a mere placeholder. While lacking the charisma of his martyred brother Louis XVI, the regent possesses something perhaps more valuable in these desperate times—a mind for numbers and administration.\n\nThe regent has moved swiftly to address France's financial catastrophe. He reorganized the treasury, bringing in experienced financiers and dismissing incompetent appointees who owed their positions to family connections rather than merit. Stock market brokers, who had operated in a chaotic grey zone since the Revolution's collapse, now find themselves subject to strict regulations and licensing requirements.\n\nA new framework for transparent accounting has been imposed across all government departments. Ministers now must justify every livre spent, with public ledgers available for inspection. Most significantly, Louis XVIII established a permanent debt repayment system—a structured plan to gradually restore France's creditworthiness with foreign banks.\n\n'A kingdom without sound finances is a ship without a rudder,' the regent declared to his ministers. 'We may have won the war, but we will lose the peace if we cannot pay our soldiers, feed our people, and honor our obligations.'\n\nThe reforms are already showing results. Inflation has begun to stabilize. Foreign investors, seeing genuine fiscal discipline, cautiously resume lending. The treasury, while far from healthy, at least now operates with predictability and order.\n\nIt is tedious, unglamorous work—but it may be exactly what France needs."
