  vendee.1.a: "Rescue The King"
  vendee.1.b: "In the dead of night, Vendéen loyalists executed a daring operation to extract the young Louis XVII from his captors in Paris. The boy-king, weak from months of imprisonment and mistreatment, was spirited away through secret passages and hidden routes known only to the most faithful royalists.\n\nAs the rescue party made their desperate flight toward Vendéen-held territory, they encountered an unexpected group of armed men blocking the forest road. Tension mounted as both sides raised their weapons—until their leader stepped forward with raised hands.\n\n'Hold your fire! We are Federalists from the Gironde,' the man announced. 'We may not share your dreams of absolute monarchy, but we share your hatred of the Jacobin tyranny. That boy deserves to live, whatever crown he may or may not wear.'\n\nThe Federalist commander introduced himself and his men—former National Guardsmen, moderate republicans, and constitutional monarchists who had fled the Terror. They offered supplies, fresh horses, and safe passage through territories they still influenced.\n\n'We seek a France of laws and liberty,' he continued, 'not the blood-soaked madness of Robespierre. Perhaps, in time, we might find common cause. A constitutional settlement, perhaps? The boy could reign, but under a charter that protects the rights of all Frenchmen.'\n\nThe Vendéen commanders faced a choice: accept these unlikely allies and consider their political proposal, or view them as republicans nonetheless—traitors who had once supported the Revolution that murdered the King."

  vendee.2.a: "Behind Closed Doors"
  vendee.2.b: "The rescue party finally reached the safety of a Vendéen outpost as dawn broke over the Loire valley. Louis XVII, still dressed in the tattered prison clothes that hung loosely on his malnourished frame, was brought into a warm room—perhaps the first warmth he had felt in months.\n\nAs loyal officers knelt before their young sovereign, the boy remained silent, his eyes hollow and distant. A physician was summoned, and food was brought, though the child barely touched it. It was only when an elderly officer—a man who had once served at Versailles—gently asked about his captivity that the dam finally broke.\n\nIn a quiet, broken voice, Louis XVII began to speak of the Temple Prison. He told of the darkness of his cell, where sunlight never reached. Of the screams he heard through the walls—his mother's screams, his aunt's prayers, sounds that haunted his sleepless nights. He spoke of Simon the cobbler, the brutal guardian appointed by the Committee, who had beaten him for refusing to denounce his own mother as a whore and a traitor.\n\n'They made me sing their songs,' the boy whispered, tears streaming down his face. 'The songs about killing kings. They laughed when I cried. They... they told me Maman was dead. That they had killed her. Is it true? Is she...?'\n\nThe room fell into awful silence. Every man present felt his blood turn to ice, then to fire. The child before them had been broken by monsters who called themselves liberators. Some officers wept openly. Others gripped their sword hilts until their knuckles turned white.\n\nThis was what the Revolution had done. This was what they were fighting against. Not abstract principles or political philosophy—but this. A tortured child who had committed no crime except being born into the wrong family.\n\nThe boy-king would need time to heal, if such wounds ever could heal. But one thing was certain: the men of the Vendée now knew, with absolute clarity, that their cause was just."
  vendee.2.c: "The Republic will answer for these crimes."
  vendee.2.d: "We must protect him from ever suffering again."
  vendee.3.a: "The Question of Women soldier"
  vendee.3.b: "The civil war has ended. The tricolor lies trampled in the mud, replaced once more by the white banner of the Bourbons. Church bells ring across a France exhausted by years of bloodshed. But in the victory parades, something unprecedented catches the eye of foreign observers and traditionalists alike—women in uniform, bearing arms, marching alongside their male comrades.\n\nThe women of the Vendée had taken up arms out of desperate necessity. When the Republic's armies came with fire and blade, when priests were drowned and villages burned, the women fought beside their fathers, husbands, and brothers. Some became scouts and messengers. Others loaded muskets and tended the wounded. A few, like the legendary Marie-Louise Victoire de Donnissan, led men into battle themselves.\n\nNow, with peace restored, these women await the young King's judgment. Many wish to return to their homes, their farms, their families—the war having taken enough from them already. But others, having tasted freedom and purpose in the ranks, petition to remain in service. They argue that they have proven themselves in blood, that they have earned the right to serve France as soldiers.\n\nThe court is divided. Conservative advisors argue that women bearing arms violates natural order and tradition—that France must return to proper Christian values after years of revolutionary chaos. Others, particularly younger officers who fought alongside these women, argue that merit and loyalty matter more than tradition, that these women bled for the King and deserve recognition.\n\nThe Catholic bishops offer no clear guidance, torn between admiration for these Judith-like defenders of the faith and concern for proper social order.\n\nLouis XVII, now a young man hardened by childhood suffering and years of war, must decide. Will he honor tradition and demobilize all female soldiers? Will he create a special auxiliary corps that acknowledges their service while maintaining separation? Or will he take the radical step of allowing them to serve as equals—a decision that would shock every court in Europe?"
  vendee.3.c: "Women soldiers are discharged with honors and pensions."
  vendee.3.d: "Let each woman choose her own path freely."
  french_surrender_done: "Republic Regime is defeated"
  vendee.4.a: "The Empty Throne"
  vendee.4.b: "The great golden gates of Versailles swung open for the first time in years, their hinges groaning like the ghosts of the old regime. Louis XVII sat motionless in the royal carriage as it passed through, his face pale and unreadable. The palace that should have been his childhood home had become a monument to everything he had lost.\n\nThe Republic had fallen. Paris had surrendered after the Coalition forces breached the final barricades. The revolutionary government collapsed into chaos as former Jacobins fled or turned on each other. Some tried to escape abroad; others were dragged from hiding by vengeful crowds. The Committee of Public Safety was no more. The guillotine in the Place de la Révolution stood silent, its blade rusted with the blood of thousands.\n\nAs the young King stepped from his carriage, he stood before the palace where his father had once ruled, where his mother had walked through glittering halls, where his aunt had prayed in the chapel. All of them were gone now—murdered by the Revolution that had promised liberty and delivered only death.\n\nThe palace itself bore the scars of revolutionary fervor. Paintings had been slashed, royal symbols defaced, furniture looted or burned. The Hall of Mirrors, once the greatest room in Europe, was covered in dust and grime. Yet it still stood, wounded but unbroken, like France itself.\n\nVendéen soldiers and Coalition troops lined the courtyards, while crowds gathered at the gates—some weeping with joy at the restoration, others watching in sullen silence, still loyal to republican ideals even in defeat. The bishops waited to offer prayers of thanksgiving. Emigré nobles who had fled years ago now rushed forward, eager to reclaim their positions and properties.\n\nLouis XVII stood at the threshold of his inheritance. He was no longer the terrified boy who had been dragged from this palace by revolutionary mobs. He was no longer the broken child who wept in a prison cell. He was a young man who had survived hell itself and emerged victorious.\n\nBut as he looked up at the vast facade of Versailles, one question burned in his mind: What kind of France would he build from the ashes of the Republic? Would he restore the old order that had fallen so catastrophically? Would he forge something new? Would he show mercy to his enemies, or would the guillotine simply change hands?\n\nThe fate of France now rested on the shoulders of a king who had known only suffering, war, and loss. History held its breath."

  federalist_waiting_tt: "§ONew decision is unlocked and you better hurry to do it!§!"
  vendee.6.b: "The gardens of Versailles bloomed once more in the spring sunlight, though the palace still bore scars from years of revolutionary occupation. Paris remained under temporary Coalition control, but here at Versailles, a new France was taking shape—one that would blend the throne with the principles of constitutional government.\n\nA delegation of moderate revolutionaries arrived at the palace gates, former Girondins and constitutional monarchists who had survived the Terror. They prepared to offer their oath of loyalty to the young King—and to receive his oath in return, pledging to govern under constitutional law.\n\nLouis XVII received them in the Hall of Mirrors,the King had transformed from the traumatized child rescued from the Temple. The darkness still lurked in his eyes at times, but it had been joined by something else—a quick wit, a gentle humor, and a remarkable absence of bitterness.\n\nAs the delegation knelt to swear their oaths, one elderly Girondin stumbled slightly, his aged knees protesting. Before any courtier could react, Louis XVII himself stepped forward and helped the man to his feet with a warm smile.\n\n'Please, monsieur, there is no need to kneel so long. France has seen enough men on their knees,' the King said softly. 'I would rather have citizens who stand upright than subjects who grovel.'\n\nThe Federalist leader, emboldened, began his prepared speech about constitutional monarchy, the rights of man, and the rule of law. Louis XVII listened attentively, occasionally asking surprisingly astute questions that revealed he had been studying political philosophy intently. When one advisor tried to hurry the proceedings along according to protocol, the King waved him off with a mischievous grin.\n\n'Let them speak, Monsieur le Duc. I spent years in a cell hearing nothing but curses and revolutionary songs. I think I can endure a few hours of political theory.'\n\nAs the ceremony concluded, the King made his own pledge—to govern justly under constitutional law, to protect the rights of all Frenchmen, and to never allow tyranny to rise again, whether in revolutionary or monarchical form. His voice was steady, his words sincere.\n\nYet in private moments afterward, those close to Louis XVII noticed something peculiar. When his tutors tried to impose rigid court etiquette, he would fall into a stubborn, silent resistance—the same silent defiance he had used to survive the Temple Prison. But the moment they softened their approach, he would apologize with disarming sweetness and explain his reasons with thoughtful eloquence.\n\nThe Federalist delegates departed Versailles cautiously optimistic. They had expected either a vengeful tyrant or a weak puppet. Instead, they found a young man who loved riding through the countryside at dawn, who treated servants with kindness, who studied late into the night, and who seemed genuinely committed to healing France's wounds.\n\nOne delegate whispered to another as they departed: 'Perhaps the Revolution did not fail entirely. It gave us a King who understands what it means to suffer, and who does not forget it.'"

Maps scattered as he slammed his fist on the table with triumphant force.\n\n'Your Majesty, gentlemen—the Federalists have risen!'\n\nThe room erupted in murmurs. Weeks ago, Vendéen agents had smuggled weapons and supplies to Federalist sympathizers in Lyon, Marseille, Bordeaux, and other southern cities. The operation had been risky—trusting republicans, even moderate ones, went against every instinct of the royalist officers. But the gamble had paid off.\n\nReports flooded in throughout the day. In Lyon, the Federalist militia had stormed the Jacobin headquarters, raising banners demanding a constitutional republic and an end to the Terror. Marseille's port district flew the tricolor alongside white flags—a symbolic gesture of alliance. Bordeaux's Girondins, who had been in hiding since their expulsion from the Convention, now commanded the city garrison. Toulouse, Caen, and a dozen smaller cities followed suit.\n\nThe Jacobin Republic now faced enemies on multiple fronts. Their armies, stretched thin fighting the Vendéen forces in the west, could not simultaneously suppress rebellions across the south and east."
  vendee.5.c: "Sybau"
  vendee.8.a: "What next?"
  vendee.8.b: "The civil war is over. The Jacobins are defeated. Louis XVII sits upon his throne once more. Yet the palace halls echo with an eerie silence—the silence of a kingdom that has lost its soul.\n\nLouis XVII, now twelve years old, shows signs of recovery from his ordeal. The nightmares come less frequently. He smiles occasionally. His tutors report that the young King demonstrates remarkable intelligence and a gentle disposition. But he remains a child—too young to rule a nation teetering on the brink of collapse.\n\nOutside the palace walls, France burns with a different fire. In Paris, occupied by Prussian troops, protesters fill the streets screaming 'Vive la République!' In Lyon, workers riot against food shortages. In Marseille, dock workers refuse to unload ships, demanding a return to revolutionary government. Across the nation, the people cry out: 'We bled for France, and you sold her to foreigners!'\n\nAnd they are not entirely wrong. The price of Vendéen victory was paid in French soil. Calais, seized by English redcoats who now drink tea in French cafés. Border villages in the Pyrenees, ceded to Spain. Strasbourg—proud Strasbourg—split like a carcass between Austrian and Prussian administrators. And Paris herself, the heart of France, occupied by Prussian soldiers who parade daily past the Tuileries in deliberate humiliation.\n\nThe foreign ambassadors make no secret of their contempt. To them, Louis XVII is not a legitimate monarch but a useful puppet. The Coalition powers demand preferential trade treaties, military access, and hefty reparations. They treat France not as an ally but as a conquered province.\n\nThe treasury is empty. The harvest has failed. Inflation spirals out of control. Bread riots erupt weekly. Former republican soldiers, now unemployed and bitter, form secret societies plotting revenge. Royalist administrators, many returned émigrés who fled years ago, govern with tone-deaf arrogance, demanding restoration of feudal privileges that only fuel popular rage.\n\nLouis XVII cannot rule alone—not yet, perhaps not for years. A regent must be appointed to navigate these treacherous waters. But who? Each candidate represents a different vision for France's future, and each choice will determine whether the restored monarchy survives or collapses into a new revolution.\n\nThe King's advisors present four names, each with passionate supporters and bitter enemies."

  vendee.10.a: "The promise"
  vendee.10.b: "The morning sun streamed through the tall windows of the versailles as Louis XVII sat at his desk, struggling with Latin declensions.  His tutor droned on about Caesar's Gallic campaigns, but Louis's attention kept drifting to the window, where he could see the palace gardens calling to him.\n\n'Your Majesty, if you could focus on the subjunctive—'\n\n'But Monsieur, didn't Caesar also enjoy riding?' Louis interrupted with a mischievous grin. 'I read that he could dictate letters while on horseback. Surely I could conjugate verbs while riding? It would be more efficient!'\n\nBefore the exasperated tutor could respond, the Chamberlain entered and bowed. 'Sire, a delegation from the Gironde has arrived. They request an audience.'\n\nLouis's face lit up immediately—anything to escape Latin grammar. 'Show them in at once!' He caught his tutor's disapproving look and added sheepishly, 'After the lesson, of course. In... how long, Monsieur?'\n\n'Another hour, Your Majesty.'\n\nLouis slumped dramatically in his chair, then caught himself and sat up straight, trying to look regal. He lasted perhaps thirty seconds before fidgeting with his quill again.\n\nWhen the delegation finally arrived, Louis bounded up from his throne—then remembered himself and sat back down with exaggerated dignity, though his eyes sparkled with barely contained energy. The Federalist leader, a stern-faced lawyer named Vergniaud, bowed formally.\n\n'Your Majesty, we come representing the departments of the Gironde, Brittany, Normandy, and Provence. We seek to remind Your Majesty of the promises made during the dark days of the civil war.'\n\nLouis leaned forward attentively, his sharp mind already working. 'I remember, Monsieur. You helped save my life. I don't forget such things.' His voice was gentle but sincere.\n\nVergniaud seemed surprised by the King's directness. 'Indeed, Sire. And in exchange, we were promised autonomy for our regions—the right to govern our own affairs, to maintain our local assemblies, to—'\n\n'To not have Paris tell you what to do,' Louis finished, smiling slightly. 'I understand. My advisors also don't like it when I refuse to follow their rules.' He glanced at his elderly tutor, who coughed disapprovingly.\n\nThe Federalist delegation exchanged uncertain looks. This was not the haughty absolute monarch they had expected.\n\nVergniaud pressed on. 'Your Majesty, we simply ask that you honor the agreement. Grant us provincial autonomy—let the Gironde govern itself, let Brittany maintain its parliament, let each region—'\n\n'Keep what makes them special,' Louis interrupted again, then caught himself. 'Forgive me, Monsieur, my mother always said I interrupt too much.' He paused, his expression growing more serious. 'But I do understand. You want to be French without forgetting who you are.'\n\nThe young King stood and walked to the window, looking out at Paris. His advisors, standing nearby, looked nervous. The Prime Minister stepped forward.\n\n'Sire, perhaps this matter should be discussed in council—'\n\nLouis waved him off without looking back. 'They came to see me, not the council.' There was a quiet stubbornness in his voice.\n\nHe turned back to the Federalists. 'You saved my life when I was a frightened child in the dark. I won't forget that. But...' He hesitated, choosing his words carefully. 'France is broken, Monsieur Vergniaud. If every region goes its own way, will there even be a France? Or just pieces that used to be something great?'\n\nVergniaud bowed his head respectfully. 'We don't seek to break France, Your Majesty. We seek to save it from the tyranny of centralization—whether Jacobin or royalist. Let each region breathe, and France will be stronger for it.'\n\nLouis was quiet for a long moment, absently bouncing on his heels—a nervous habit his attendants had tried to break him of. Finally, he spoke.\n\n'I need to think about this. And... I should probably ask people who know more than I do.' He smiled self-deprecatingly. 'I'm quite good at riding and geography, but governing... that's harder than Caesar's subjunctive.'\n\nHe walked directly up to Vergniaud and extended his hand—a shockingly informal gesture that made the courtiers gasp. 'Give me time, Monsieur. I promise I won't forget what you did for me. A Bourbon always pays his debts.'"

The Austrians, having held the Marquis de Lafayette in their fortress at Olmütz for years, have decided his fate is no longer their concern. With characteristic Habsburg pragmatism, they have transferred the famous general to Vendéen custody, washing their hands of a man who embarrasses all sides.\n\nGilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, now stands in chains before the court of the young King he once served—and whose family he failed to save. The 'Hero of Two Worlds' who fought for American liberty and French reform now appears gaunt and aged, his revolutionary ideals having led to nothing but terror and tyranny.\n\nThe constitutional monarchists see an opportunity. Lafayette championed a British-style monarchy with the King as a symbolic figurehead—precisely what they envision for France's future. His prestige, especially with the Americans, could legitimize a moderate settlement. 'He made mistakes,' they argue, 'but he tried to save Louis XVI. He fled the Jacobins just as we did.'\n\nThe absolutists are incensed. 'This man stripped your father of his powers!' they remind the King. 'He commanded the mob that imprisoned the Royal Family at the Tuileries! His constitutional fantasies paved the road to the guillotine! He is a traitor who deserves a traitor's death!'\n\nThe Federalist advisors offer a middle path: clemency in exchange for public service. Lafayette's military expertise and international connections could prove valuable, and mercy would demonstrate that constitutional monarchy is not vengeance.\n\nLouis XVII studies the prisoner in silence. Here stands the man who once swore to protect the Royal Family, who commanded the National Guard that failed to stop the Revolution's descent into madness. The King remembers his father's letters, which spoke of Lafayette with both disappointment and a strange, persistent hope that the Marquis might yet prove loyal.\n\nWhat justice does Lafayette deserve?

Some are unrepentant ideologues, still muttering about liberty and virtue even in their cells. Others are broken men, begging for mercy they never showed their own victims.\n\nThe court demands blood for blood. Families who lost fathers, sons, and daughters in the Vendée massacres cry out for justice. The Catholic bishops speak of righteous punishment for crimes against God and man. Even moderate voices acknowledge that some accountability must be demanded.\n\nYet Louis XVII has seen enough of revolutionary 'justice'—the mock trials, the tumbrels rolling toward the scaffold, the cheering crowds. He knows what it means to be helpless before judges who have already decided your guilt. The question haunts him in quiet moments... if he orders mass executions, how is he different from them?\n\nThree paths lie before the young King. He can exile the Jacobin leadership, scattering them across Europe as living warnings but avoiding further bloodshed. He can offer a general amnesty, drawing a line under the past and seeking reconciliation—a radical mercy that would shock both his own supporters and foreign courts.

The Austrians, having tired of housing this embarrassment, have delivered him into Vendéen hands with a simple message: 'Do with him as you please.'\n\nThe charges are read aloud, each one met with growls of anger from the assembled loyalists. Treason against the Crown. Complicity in the imprisonment of the Royal Family. Commanding the forces that failed—or refused—to protect Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. Propagating the poisonous doctrines of constitutional monarchy that weakened the throne and enabled the Jacobin terror.\n\n'I served France,' Lafayette protests weakly. 'I tried to save the King. I fled the Revolution when it turned to madness—'\n\n'You created that madness!' an officer shouts. 'Your American ideals, your National Assembly, your constitutional fantasies—all of it led to the guillotine! The King's blood is on your hands as surely as if you wielded the blade yourself!'\n\nThe prosecution presents damning evidence: Lafayette's letters advocating limits on royal power, his orders to the National Guard during the October Days when the mob dragged the Royal Family from Versailles, his failure to prevent the flight to Varennes from becoming a disaster. Most damningly, they read his pamphlets calling for a monarchy 'restrained by law'—words that sound like blasphemy in this room of absolute monarchists.\n\nYet even here, some voices counsel caution. An elderly nobleman notes that Lafayette was imprisoned by the very revolutionaries he supposedly served—proof that even the Jacobins saw him as an enemy. A priest reminds the court that vengeance belongs to God, and that mercy is a kingly virtue. A pragmatic general suggests that executing a man famous in America and England might damage Vendée's hopes for foreign recognition and support.\n\nBut the civil war still rages. Republican armies still burn churches and murder priests across France.

It is a monument to rebellion, a temple of regicide, the birthplace of France's nightmare.\n\nYet some pragmatic advisors argue the institution might be preserved in neutered form—an advisory body with no real power, maintaining the appearance of consultation while the King rules as his ancestors did.

But in the dungeons of reclaimed fortresses and requisitioned buildings, another group awaits judgment—the Federalists.\n\nThese men had been enemies of the Jacobins, opponents of Robespierre's tyranny. Some had even offered aid during the darkest days of the war. But they had also been revolutionaries once, men who had voted for a Republic, who had supported the overthrow of Louis XVI.

When his advisors present the Federalist question, he listens carefully to all sides.\n\nThe hardline royalists demand blood. 'They are republicans, Your Majesty,' declares the Comte de Charette. 'They supported the Revolution. They may have turned against the Jacobins, but only when the Terror threatened them personally. They would have been content to let France remain a republic. They must face justice.'\n\nOthers counsel pragmatism. 'The Federalists control significant territories, Sire,' explains a senior minister. 'Many are skilled administrators, military officers, men of education. To execute them all would create martyrs and deprive France of talent she desperately needs. We have already lost so many...'\n\nThe Catholic clergy urges mercy. 'Our Lord taught forgiveness, Your Majesty. These men have renounced the Jacobin madness. Some have already sworn loyalty to the Crown. If we show mercy, we demonstrate that royal justice is superior to revolutionary vengeance.'\n\nLouis XVII sits in silence for a long moment, his fingers tracing the scars on his wrists—reminders of shackles worn in childhood. Finally, he speaks, and all present lean forward to hear the King's judgment."

  vendee.9.a: "Bitter past"
  vendee.9.b: "The morning sun cast long shadows across the grounds of Versailles as the young King pursued his daily ritual. Louis XVII, dressed in simple riding clothes rather than royal regalia, practiced swordsmanship against a training post with remarkable energy for a boy who had spent years in darkness. His tutor watched from a respectful distance as he moved with surprising grace—parrying, lunging, laughing when he stumbled.\n\n'Your Majesty fights well,' came a voice from behind. 'Though your footwork needs attention.'\n\nLouis XVII spun around, wooden practice sword still raised, to see a tall figure in a general's uniform approaching. The tricolor cockade pinned prominently to his hat caught the boy's eye immediately—that hated symbol of the Revolution. The young King's playful expression vanished, replaced by something colder, more guarded.\n\n'Monsieur de Lafayette,' Louis XVII said quietly, lowering his sword but not sheathing it. His voice carried an edge that seemed too mature for his years. 'My regent, I am told. The hero of America. The champion of liberty.' A pause. 'The man my father said betrayed him.'\n\nLafayette stopped several paces away and removed his hat, bowing deeply. When he straightened, his weathered face showed no anger at the accusation—only profound sadness.\n\n'Your Majesty speaks the truth his father knew,' Lafayette replied softly. 'Louis XVI did feel betrayed by me. And perhaps... perhaps he was not wrong to feel so.'\n\nThe boy tilted his head, curiosity breaking through his defensive posture. 'You admit it?'\n\n'I admit that I failed him, Sire.' Lafayette moved closer, his hands open and empty. 'Your father was a good man—better than most who wore crowns. Kind. Thoughtful. He cared deeply for France and for his family.' His voice caught slightly. 'When the Revolution began, I believed... I believed we could have both. A king and liberty. Your father on his throne, but France with a constitution, with rights, with laws that bound even monarchs.'\n\nLouis XVII's grip on his practice sword loosened slightly. 'Maman spoke of you sometimes. In the Temple. Before they... before...' He couldn't finish.\n\n'I know, Your Majesty.' Lafayette knelt on one knee, bringing himself to eye level with the boy. 'I failed them both. When the mob came to Versailles in 1789, I commanded the National Guard, but I could not control them. When your father tried to flee to Varennes, I was the one who helped capture him—because I still believed, foolishly, that we could preserve both throne and constitution. And when the Jacobins seized power, when Robespierre's Terror began...' His voice hardened. 'I fled to Austria rather than face the guillotine. I was imprisoned there while your family suffered. I was not there to protect you.'\n\nThe young King stared at him, his expression unreadable—that stubborn silence his governess had warned Lafayette about, the way the boy retreated into himself when confronted.\n\nLafayette continued, his voice thick with emotion. 'Your Majesty has every right to hate me. Your father died believing I betrayed him. Your mother went to the scaffold while I sat in an Austrian cell. And you—' His composure finally cracked. 'You were tortured by the very Revolution I helped begin. The ideals I championed were twisted into weapons used against a child. How can I ask your forgiveness for that?'\n\nFor a long moment, silence hung between them. A bird sang somewhere in the gardens. The breeze rustled through the trees.\n\nThen Louis XVII did something unexpected. He dropped his practice sword and sat down on the grass—an utterly un-regal gesture that made his watching tutor gasp. He patted the ground beside him.\n\n'Sit with me, Monsieur,' the boy said quietly. 'Not as regent and king. Just... sit.'\n\nLafayette, surprised, lowered himself to sit cross-legged beside the young King.\n\n'Maman told me something,' Louis XVII said, pulling at the grass absently. 'In the Temple, before they took her away. She said that people who make mistakes aren't always bad people. That Papa made mistakes too—trusted the wrong advisors, waited too long to act. She said...' His voice became very small. 'She said the hardest thing in the world is to do what you think is right when everyone around you is doing wrong.'\n\nHe looked up at Lafayette with eyes that had seen far too much for twelve years. 'You tried to save Papa and still keep France from drowning in blood. You failed. But Simon the cobbler didn't fail—he meant to hurt me, and he did. The Jacobins didn't fail—they wanted to kill my family, and they succeeded.' A tremor ran through the boy's voice. 'You failed because you tried to save everyone. They succeeded because they wanted to destroy.'\n\nLafayette found his vision blurring. 'Your Majesty is... remarkably wise for one so young.'\n\n'I'm not wise,' the boy said with sudden fierceness, his stubborn streak emerging. 'I just... I remember the dark. I remember the cold. I remember thinking that everyone in the world wanted me dead.' He turned to look directly at Lafayette. 'You're wearing that tricolor cockade—the symbol of the Revolution—and yet you Still loyal to me. Why?'\n\n'Because, Your Majesty,' Lafayette said softly, touching the cockade on his hat, 'this does not mean what Robespierre made it mean. This is not a symbol of terror and murder. This is the symbol of the idea that all men are born free and equal—including kings. That power must be tempered by law. That France belongs to all her people, not just to nobles or radicals.' He met the boy's gaze steadily. 'I wear this because I still believe in those ideals. But I kneel before you because I believe a nation needs both—liberty AND order. Rights AND responsibility. A king who respects his people, and people who respect their king.'\n\nLouis XVII considered this seriously, then suddenly his face broke into a grin—the playful child emerging again. 'So you want me to be a king who follows rules? Even when I don't want to?'\n\nLafayette couldn't help but smile back. 'Especially when you don't want to, Sire.'\n\n'That sounds boring,' the boy said, but his eyes were twinkling. Then, more seriously: 'Monsieur de Lafayette, I cannot forgive you for Papa and Maman. That hurt is... it's too big. Not yet.' His voice dropped to a whisper. 'But maybe... maybe someday I can. If you help me understand. If you teach me how to be the kind of king who doesn't make people want to cut off heads.'\n\n'I would be honored to try, Your Majesty,' Lafayette said, bowing his head.\n\nThe boy stood up suddenly, bouncing on his toes with recovered energy. 'Good! Then you can start by teaching me proper footwork. You said mine was terrible.'\n\n'I said it needed attention, Sire.'\n\n'Same thing!' Louis XVII laughed—a clear, genuine sound that seemed to surprise even himself. 'Come on, Monsieur le Régent. Show me how Americans fight.'\n\nAs Lafayette rose and picked up the practice sword, showing the eager young King the proper stance, both knew that the road ahead would be difficult. France was broken. The people were angry. Foreign armies occupied French soil. But in that moment, in the gardens of Versailles, there was something that hadn't existed in France for years: hope.\n\nA hope that perhaps this time, they could build something that would last. A France with both a crown and a constitution. A king who had known suffering and might therefore rule with compassion. And a regent who had failed once, but might yet succeed in creating the nation he had always dreamed of—one where liberty and monarchy could coexist.\n\nThe young King laughed again as he attempted a lunge and nearly fell. Lafayette caught him, steadying him.\n\n'Again, Sire?'\n\n'Again!' Louis XVII declared cheerfully. 'And this time I won't fall. Probably.'"
